Videos/82646/Visite_1/82646_Question_3_2024-11-12_18-40-35_Video.mp4,0,The first thing that came to mind was probably cutting my own hair. I've been doing that for the last few years. I don't know, it's just tedious. I'm not very good at it. I dread thinking about it. I'm due for it, yeah. I don't know, it's a hassle. I don't have eyes behind my head. I use a mirror all around me. me i'm just yeah i'm not a fan of buzzing my own hair basically it's it's it's tricky yeah the same goes for grooming not not a fan but i have to do it it is what it is
Videos/82646/Visite_1/82646_Question_4_2024-11-12_18-42-19_Video.mp4,1,This one's going to sound really odd, but I think my answer would have to be working. I work way too much, but I enjoy it. I'm aware I work too much, but yeah, I should probably cut down my hours. Yeah. Yeah.

Videos/82625/Visite_1/82625_Question_1_2024-11-06_07-43-48_Video.mp4,1,After waking up, I generally grab my phone, which is a habit that I'm trying not to continue, but that's usually what I'll do. After that, I will get up and do a small stretch, make my bed, brush my teeth, and then if I'm up to it, I'll go for a walk. It doesn't always work out that way, though.
Videos/82625/Visite_1/82625_Question_2_2024-11-06_07-44-59_Video.mp4,0,An activity that brings me joy would be camping. I live in the city and I find it refreshing to be out in the woods and going for hikes. And I really just enjoy the process of setting up the tent, arranging the campsite, being out in nature and some peace and quiet for a couple of days.
Videos/82625/Visite_1/82625_Question_3_2024-11-06_07-45-57_Video.mp4,0,I don't like to do laundry, which I'm doing today because I live in an apartment building and it seems like there's always something broken. Today it was the pay machine, so I had to walk up the street to another building. Also the cost, it's expensive per load as opposed to owning my own washing machine. So yeah, do not like that. Very annoying. Thank you.
Videos/82625/Visite_1/82625_Question_4_2024-11-06_07-47-07_Video.mp4,1,An activity I'd like to stop would be drinking alcohol. I used to quite enjoy it, but these days I find that the, the issues outweigh the benefits. I generally don't feel well for a couple of days after maybe even longer, in terms of my mental wellbeing. And I'm just hearing a lot about how bad it is for your body. It's kind of an accepted thing, but it really is almost as bad as smoking from what I understand.
Videos/82625/Visite_1/82625_Question_5_2024-11-06_07-48-22_Video.mp4,1,I'm almost always willing to go for a walk. I find it resets my brain. I work on the computer a lot and it's just I find I feel a lot better afterwards. I definitely love to do it with friends. I also like to do it just on my own as well. It's kind of a meditation.
Videos/82625/Visite_1/82625_Question_6_2024-11-06_07-50-40_Video.mp4,1,Something that a lot of people around me do here in Nova Scotia is smoke weed. I used to quit a long time ago. It really doesn't sit well with me. But it's hard. It's very hard to meet someone who does not partake in that lifestyle around here. Very, very difficult. It's prevalent at work. It's prevalent at home. at home, I have friends, I have family. It's literally everywhere, but it's an activity that I choose not to do for my health.
Videos/82625/Visite_1/82625_Question_7_2024-11-06_07-49-28_Video.mp4,1,Currently I'm putting off finding a second job. The economy is tough right now in Canada and everywhere. I'm trying to save for a house so it would benefit me to find a second job. Um, I think the amount of work is causing me to procrastinate a little bit, but I know I'm capable of it at least for a year or so.
Videos/82643/Visite_1/82643_Question_1_2024-11-11_14-46-13_Video.mp4,0,After I usually wake up, usually I wake up, I'll check my phone for any work messages, check my schedule for the day, see what I'm working, see what projects I have to work on, see if anybody's sent me messages about work related items or work related things I have to do just so when I go into work I can be prepared and I know what I'm doing and what my team is supposed to be doing as well. Yeah, I think that's pretty good I think.
Videos/82643/Visite_1/82643_Question_2_2024-11-11_14-53-52_Video.mp4,0,uh so then that brings me joy uh hobby um lego i'm a really big lego fan um i love building lego get you know a big set of like you know thousands of parts uh buy these big sets uh like the million falcon and uh the hogwarts castle um you know it's like you know i think 5 000 pieces i actually love getting like the bags um you know they're all they're all uh you know you know loose and then you know you spend time put them together building them up over you know a few days or a few weeks or whatever I just love the progress there you know just starting from like nothing basically and then getting with a huge structure that we you know lasts forever pretty much unless you took it down but yeah just it brings me joy it sort of relaxes me and just like sit there with like the instruction book and a big bag of lego pieces and build it and yeah it's just makes me happy
Videos/82643/Visite_1/82643_Question_4_2024-11-11_14-52-19_Video.mp4,1,An activity I enjoy but would like to stop, I'd like to stop eating so much junk food. I do eat a lot of junk food and it's tasty, I like it, but it's obviously not very good for me so I'd like to stop it. Usually when I'm at home in the evenings and just watching TV or something like that, a little bit bored, I'll just eat chips or some candy or some chocolate and that's it. So yeah it's good but I would definitely I do enjoy eating it but I would like to stop it for sure just because it's not good for my health so yeah that's what I'd like to stop doing.
Videos/82643/Visite_1/82643_Question_5_2024-11-11_14-57-20_Video.mp4,1,Something I'm almost always going to do, probably go to the bar with my friends. I'm always going to do that if one of my friends suggests it, I'm always pretty much down for that. Obviously, me and my friends, we're spread out all over the city. We all have jobs and stuff like that and different work schedules. So it can be tough to arrange and stuff like that. also money as well as an issue with everyone's you know a bit tighter on money but if one of my friends is willing to do that and um you know if it's just one friend or a couple of friends um I'm pretty much always willing to do that um even if I go there and don't spend too much money um I'll probably still do it uh just because look we don't get together too often so um if you know one of my friends is suggesting we do do it then I'm you know pretty much always gonna say yes you know because yeah we don't do it too often and it's good to get together with friends and hang out and talk about lives and all that fun stuff
Videos/82643/Visite_1/82643_Question_6_2024-11-11_14-58-52_Video.mp4,0,uh something that um my friends do but i would not do i probably smoke or vape a lot of my friends uh smoke i either smoke or vape or i do both um and i've never been a smoker in my whole life i don't think i would ever start or vape even even if it wasn't you know nicotine even if it wasn't like one of those nicotine vapes it was just like the flavored vapes i still wouldn't do it um my mum smoked when I was growing up I hate the hate that habit that she did or still does actually um and uh yeah a lot of my friends do do that at work and stuff and uh not at home but my friends smoke and my uh all my work colleagues smoke and I'm sometimes outside with them um you know talking and uh stuff like that but I wouldn't um start smoking or vaping um because I just don't like the habit and I think it's pretty gross and yeah.
Videos/82643/Visite_1/82643_Question_7_2024-11-11_14-55-20_Video.mp4,1,Something that I could have done but haven't done yet, probably getting my Canadian citizenship. I've been in Canada for 11 years now, almost 12 actually. And I could have got my permanent resident, but I could have got my citizenship. I just haven't done it yet. I keep putting it off and putting it off. It's a lot of paperwork to fill out. I get like criminal background checks and do a test and stuff like that. and I want to do it I just you know I haven't had the time and it's just so much I say so much paperwork that's kind of daunting I keep putting it off but I'll get to it at some point for sure but I probably should have done it by now but you know I've had six years where I've been qualified to be a Canadian citizen and I still haven't so hopefully I can get to it pretty soon there but yeah that's something that I keep putting off but haven't decided to do yet Thank you.
Videos/82818/Visite_1/82818_Question_1_2025-02-01_10-12-07_Video.mp4,0,So usually after I wake up I will turn my phone on and read the news briefings of the morning and anything that's happened in the investments across the world.
Videos/82818/Visite_1/82818_Question_2_2025-02-01_10-17-08_Video.mp4,1,One of the activities that brings me joy is working around the house with my hands. So either doing electrical work or plumbing or anything that's hands-on, a manual task, gardening. I enjoy that because it just gets me active, gets me thinking about something that's outside of my regular realm of domain.
Videos/82818/Visite_1/82818_Question_3_2025-02-01_10-15-15_Video.mp4,1,I don't like doing housework because simply I see it as a waste of time, but I know it needs to get done, even though if dirt and dust piles up around the house. So spending time to clean the house is something I do not like.
Videos/82818/Visite_1/82818_Question_4_2025-02-01_10-16-30_Video.mp4,1,The activity that I like to do, I guess, would be cooking, cooking for family. It brings a nice endorphin rush to me and I enjoy it.
Videos/82672/Visite_1/82672_Question_1_2024-11-13_19-50-01_Video.mp4,0,So when I wake up, I stand up from the bed, get into the bedroom, make ablution. I'm a Muslim, so I make ablution to say my morning prayers. Then I pray my morning prayer, have my bath, I arrange my meal for the day before I set out for work for the day. So that's what I usually do when I wake up in the morning.

I mean, it's everything, you know, the thrill, the excitement, the passion, the zeal. So there's a lot of emotions involved when it comes to football. So that is why I watch football. That's why I play football. And that's why I follow football. And there's music and there's movies as well. So just pure entertainment.
Videos/82672/Visite_1/82672_Question_3_2024-11-13_19-59-03_Video.mp4,1,So I'm currently between jobs. So I'm currently job hunting looking for a steady source of income and applying to jobs is really tedious. I find it really boring. it's because of the way the landscape has changed, AI and the computing world where everything now is based on what the computers have evolved into. So it's really hard to get a job. And it's even really hard when you have to always have to tailor your resume to fit each job role. So it's a little bit strenuous, tiring. I really do not like it at all. Thank you.

Videos/82672/Visite_1/82672_Question_7_2024-11-13_19-51-21_Video.mp4,1,So I'm thinking of doing my, or combating my education from back home in Nigeria. My education certificate for me to be able to teach from Nigeria back home in Nigeria to a Canadian one where it is approved.

Videos/82614/Visite_1/82614_Question_1_2024-11-05_13-28-19_Video.mp4,1,So one activity I usually do after working out is to grab my phone and text my partner because we don't live together so I do that. I go through my emails and every week I stand up to go clean up.

Videos/82891/Visite_1/82891_Question_5_2025-02-25_15-44-48_Video.mp4,0,An activity that I'm always willing to do for, I'll start with friends. If they need help in any kind of social engagements, babysitting, if they need help with anything at home, example like cleaning or getting groceries done, or even people that are still in school that are friends if they need help uh with homework or help us that need a study buddy i'm willing to do that it helps advance them um with family i'm willing to do basically anything if they they call and and tell me mom i need this and mama need that i go right away uh my grandchildren i'd do anything for so i'm a very giving person so if somebody really asks for something I have no problem with helping them out. At home I'm willing to do basically a bit more than what instead of like 50 50 I do a bit more because that's just me I feel like I just need to give more of myself.
Videos/82891/Visite_1/82891_Question_7_2025-02-25_15-46-56_Video.mp4,1,Something I've been putting off or haven't decided on yet is putting cigarettes. I've tried many times to take the patch. I've tried pills. I've tried Nicorette gums. I've tried lozenges. I've tried a lot. I've been smoking since I was 15. I'm 54 now. now. My lungs aren't that great and doctors have told me I need to quit, but it's something hard to do. But I keep putting it off. I've tried twice. The second time I got down to three cigarettes, but then my son moved out so my nerves kicked in. I have five children, so the last one he was pretty hard on me. I keep putting it off, but right now I'm still focusing on my weight and I will again try to quit cigarettes.
Videos/82808/Visite_1/82808_Question_1_2025-01-31_16-33-14_Video.mp4,0,Tell us about an activity you do after waking up. After waking up, I will go downstairs. I will go to the washroom. I will use the restroom. That's typically before taking my shower. After I've taken my shower, I'll go to the kitchen and start coffee. That is, of course, before starting to get dressed for work. That is my morning routine.
Videos/82808/Visite_1/82808_Question_2_2025-01-31_16-41-19_Video.mp4,1,I love playing guitar. I've been playing guitar for 15 years, maybe more. I've always been into music, been into playing it, writing it, recording it, listening to it, you name it. So I really, really enjoy playing guitar. Recently, I've been trying to write some of my own music and record some of that. Hopefully in this year, I'll succeed in putting some of that up, posting that and hopefully sharing that with some friends and and maybe some strangers that have similar musical taste to me i think it's just tell us why so i think it's a lot of fun i think it's a great way to express yourself i think it's really rewarding to finally practice a song and get it down it's really rewarding to write something that sounds really good um it's just fun i think it's a great you know, low effort, low barrier to entry way to have fun at home, pretty well zero cost. Once you have a guitar, once you have an instrument, for instance, you know, you can get together with friends and write, share tips, tricks and stuff like that, teach each other things. So it's a lot of fun. I think it helps people build connections and it helps individuals creatively express themselves. So I really think it's a great activity.
Videos/82808/Visite_1/82808_Question_3_2025-01-31_16-39-37_Video.mp4,1,an activity i don't like to do uh shoveling snow absolutely uh living in quebec we get a lot of snow depending on the year this year it's not been so much but when it hits uh it really it really it really drops on us so uh it can end up being 20 30 40 minutes of uh really intense exercise um in extreme cold and at the same time you begin sweating uh it's just a really really nasty feeling all around particularly if it's negative 10 20 degrees celsius outside all of a sudden you're just caught somewhere between exhausted overheating and freezing so uh yeah i would say shoveling snow absolute nightmare don't like it
Videos/82808/Visite_1/82808_Question_4_2025-01-31_16-38-34_Video.mp4,1,an activity I enjoy, but I would like to stop. Actually, I'm in the process of quitting smoking. So I've been smoking cigarettes for about over a decade for sure. And then I switched to vaporizing in the last four or so years, perhaps. It's been two weeks now that I've stopped. So I'm looking to quit that essentially. I'd consider it certainly a guilty pleasure. It's costing me a lot of money. It's costing me my health. So yeah, I would say, although I do enjoy it, frankly, something I would like to stop and I'm aiming to, I hope I'll be able to this year.
Videos/82808/Visite_1/82808_Question_5_2025-01-31_16-35-56_Video.mp4,0,An activity that I'm almost always willing to do would likely be watching movies, and maybe comedy movies, action, adventure movies. That's something that I'm particularly always in the mood for. If given the opportunity with friends at home, even at work, absolutely I would take that opportunity and watch a movie. I really enjoy it.
Videos/82808/Visite_1/82808_Question_6_2025-01-31_16-35-03_Video.mp4,0,people around me often post very personal photos and information on social media typically I'm not willing to do that myself not in the past few years anyways I much more value my privacy particularly I'm not looking for validation from strangers or even internet friends so I'm very often not willing to post on social media particularly for clout as people call it.

Videos/82734/Visite_1/82734_Question_2_2024-11-20_16-09-07_Video.mp4,0,I really love gardening outside and in my greenhouse. I like to grow vegetables and fruits and I find it really therapeutic and fun to do. It's exciting to plant seeds and see their progress throughout the weeks and take care of them, identify any issues with them, if there's any pests that are causing like your tomatoes not to grow, for example. And it's also really rewarding because then you get to eat the food when you harvest it. And I find it really fun to be able to, for example, make a salad with ingredients that I entirely grew outside. It's also a hobby that's fun to share with people, so I can give my family and friends some of the fruits and vegetables that I've grown, make jams and stuff and give them as gifts. And I guess I also just like the aspect of being outside in the sun, getting fresh air. It's hard work, but it doesn't feel like work. I enjoy it.
Videos/82734/Visite_1/82734_Question_3_2024-11-20_16-06-31_Video.mp4,0,I don't like when it snows a lot and I have to shovel all of the snow outside. It takes a long time to do. It's really cold and unpleasant outside when doing it. It's hard work, so it makes you really tired. And it's just really time-consuming as well. With a big snowfall, it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. And it snows a lot where I live, so it's something I find myself having to do. pretty regularly.

I've recently started experimenting with baking more and found that it is quite enjoyable but I think it would be really satisfying and healthy and tasty to make homemade bread so at some point I'd like to buy a bread machine and kind of explore that trying different breads like sourdoughs and so on. When have more time. I've been really busy with work so it's hard to find time to start that new activity and also keep up the things I'm working on now, but I think I would enjoy that.

If I get invited out for a meal at either a new restaurant or one that we go to regularly, I'm pretty much always willing to go. It's a lot of fun. It doesn't really matter if I had a long or hard day at work. It's nice to get out and spend time with my friends. So it's very rare that I would not go unless I was like really sick and couldn't make it but otherwise I always want to go out and try new food and spend time with my friends and family trying out different restaurants in the city.

I like to hang them up. I don't want to use the dryer so much for the noise and energy rhythm. but and I can look at it right now like but as soon as I set it up I've started hanging the thing and it will stay there until I need space on the on the hanger again so I don't and it could be like a five minute thing but like I don't really like folding I don't really like taking care of that Thanks.

And I live like half an hour away from ski resorts so it could be an easy thing to do but for some reason I'm also a bit scared. Last time I did it was like about 10 years ago. But it has changed, obviously. And I feel like it's something you could do as a kid easily, and then once you become an adult, it's just harder to get good. Nothing is as intuitive as it used to be as a kid, especially the body. But yeah, it's definitely something I'd like to do maybe next winter or before the end of this winter.

I wouldn't want to do that. I mean, yeah, I guess you can be friends with coworkers, but still, I think it's important to keep a boundary between, especially with supervisors and hierarchy the dynamics. It's weird to be friends with a manager, I think, but maybe it's my culture that means that.
Videos/82888/Visite_1/82888_Question_7_2025-02-24_17-20-48_Video.mp4,1,Hmm. Tough question. Well, for instance, I like to change my couch so that I get a new couch. I think I could have done it by now. I think I've got the tools to change it.

Videos/82636/Visite_1/82636_Question_2_2024-11-06_22-06-35_Video.mp4,1,An activity that brings me joy that's kind of a hobby is writing pen pal letters. My partner and I are long distance so I enjoy writing snail mail letters to them. And I enjoy this because it keeps me connected with my partner and it's kind of a soothing activity. It's almost meditative, kind of physically writing everything out and kind of picking out like stickers or little extras that I include in the letter is kind of a fun bonus. Yeah.
Videos/82636/Visite_1/82636_Question_3_2024-11-06_22-07-40_Video.mp4,0,I really, it's kind of childish I guess, but I really don't enjoy folding laundry and putting laundry away. I find it tedious and I mostly, I find it kind of daunting even though it's quite a simple task, but for some reason it's just kind of seeing I guess like a big pile of laundry that needs to be put away and folded and organized and everything. It kind of, it feels like a much bigger task than it actually is. And so I tend to procrastinate it or I'll kind of leave it out of sight, out of mind. So yeah, really folding laundry is quite boring, I guess, to me, or annoying.

Whatever people need, I don't mind volunteering my time or my effort to doing something. Something people around me do that I would not be willing to do. I guess like making appointments over the phone. I guess that's something that people around me sometimes do. I am not a big fan of making phone calls, especially because I have a very bad memory. And when I'm nervous, I have an even worse memory. So, yeah, I guess people around me, like, I don't know why it's popping in my head, but, like, my mom makes phone calls really easily and, like, sets up appointments really easily. but that's something that I am not always ready and willing to do, I guess.

They're due in like a month and I have not started yet, nor have I looked really seriously into master's degree funding. That is absolutely something I've been procrastinating on. It's very daunting and I want to do it and I want to apply, but I think because I'm expecting not to be accepted, I've just been kind of putting it off on the back burner because I'm not thinking that it'll be something kind of realistically feasible. So yeah, absolutely could have at least started my grad school applications by now, but I have not yet.

Then you got to take it out, fold it, take it all the way back upstairs and then put it away. So it just seems like it's an all day affair to do like a load of laundry.

It doesn't matter if a coworker asks me to go to trivia, a friend asked me to go trivia, a family member asked me to go to trivia, I'm going to trivia and I'm going to have a good time. I love the atmosphere of pubs and breweries. Like they're so chill and, and casual. And then I love doing trivia. You know, I feel like I have a wide knowledge of really random things. So I go regularly with my friends on Thursday nights. But other than that, though, if anybody asked me to go to trivia, I'm always down.

So, you know, that's kind of where you wedge your body into small crevices and caves and stuff. And I think it's called like spelunking or something weird like that. But, you know, he's talked about it a couple of times. I've seen a couple Instagram reels and that's just not for me. It looks so scary and claustrophobic and dark and gross and just nothing about it seems attractive to me. Nothing about that activity makes me want to do it. I'm not really a thrill seeker. But if I was, that would be the last one I would ever, ever, ever do.

So I keep kind of kicking the can down the road to avoid the cat conversation, but I know she's going to win the battle and we're going to end up getting a cat. So, you know, it's just something that I don't really want to do. I'm not really a cat person. The idea of a litter box in my house and, you know, they're scratching everything and fur everywhere. It's just not an attractive idea to me, but she's dead set on getting a cat. So I keep putting it off and putting it off and putting it off. But I feel like, you know, that it's just inevitable and I'm just delaying the inevitable.
