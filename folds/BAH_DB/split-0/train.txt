I think it would help me both mentally and help me become more intellectual.

Videos/82645/Visite_1/82645_Question_6_2024-11-11_15-27-42_Video.mp4,1,I've learned more and more about myself that I'm kind of a walking set of contradictions. In my previous answer, I said that I'm very comfortable with public speaking, but something that I'm not as willing to do is actually small talk. And it turns out that I like speaking when everyone has to listen to me, and it's maybe not as much of a conversation, but when it's just the typical things that people talk about in the in-between moments, catching up on current events, you know, how high are gas prices, what did you buy at the grocery store today, I find myself very unwilling to participate in that small talk because I find it boring. And unfortunately, for most cases, people think that I'm shy, reserved, uncomfortable, but the reality is, is that I'm comfortable talking, I'm just not willing to do it. I can only say that apparently I'm possessive of my time down to very minute details. If I don't think a conversation is worth having, I'm not going to have it. And so with my friends at work and even at home, I let other people do the small talk. My mind tends to gravitate towards the bigger picture and big ideas. And I'm so unfocused on small things like that that I think if I were to try I don't think I'd be good at it anyway.

Reading gives me a lot of joy because I am learning from the stories of the characters and sometimes I read financial books and I enjoy reading them because I feel like I'm learning a lot of valuable tips through other stories and I feel like it's a better way to entertain myself rather than going through social media.

Videos/82645/Visite_1/82645_Question_2_2024-11-11_15-17-41_Video.mp4,0,Throughout basically my entire life, an activity that I've enjoyed very, very much is gaming. So since about the age of five, I've been gaming on consoles, computers, phones, essentially whatever I can get my hands on. and I would say that it's been a hobby for the entirety of my life because it has brought me joy and I would say this joy stems from mostly a feeling of accomplishment. I like playing difficult games, overcoming challenges, learning how to accomplish said challenges and that feeling of accomplishment does bring me a lot of joy. But sometimes I like to play games that I've played many, many times before. And I experience a joy just being in those virtual worlds, I would say. So I think it's the escapism that provides the joy, the sense of adventure. It's not always accomplishment, even though that's a big factor. But no, I would say so much so that gaming is the activity I do when I don't feel like doing anything else, when I feel like I'm out of energy, it always tends to help me feel revitalized with the joy it can bring.

That's just something I don't find enjoyable. It's a responsibility that I don't want to take on but sometimes I get tasked with it. with it and when I'm around my peers sometimes I feel guilty that I have to do that for everyone living there so yeah I just don't enjoy it but sometimes you just have to get it done

It allows me to explore a lot of different places and the science and the tranquility is always good.

Videos/82807/Visite_1/82807_Question_6_2025-01-30_18-38-25_Video.mp4,0,A bunch of my friends love going to the gym and working out almost every day. That's one thing that no matter how much convincing, I detest going to a gym and doing organized workout activities. It's the last thing I would want to do, and no matter how much protening, I always will say no to it.
Videos/82553/Visite_1/82553_Question_7_2024-08-22 12-14-07_Video.mp4,1,So far I've put off doing some research on figuring out what the next few months of my life will look like in terms of work, family, and friends.

Videos/82704/Visite_1/82704_Question_2_2024-11-18_13-37-42_Video.mp4,1,I like to read. I read quite a bit. Various books from different authors, covering different subjects, genres, things like that. I basically like storytelling and I like knowledge gain, so that kind of works well for me.

Videos/82815/Visite_1/82815_Question_2_2025-01-31_22-24-13_Video.mp4,1,Gaming brings me a ton of joy, mainly because I enjoy being at the computer and that social interaction I get playing games with friends, or that competitiveness that I can get, that feeling I can get from playing games and competing against others.
Videos/82619/Visite_1/82619_Question_3_2024-11-05_14-53-10_Video.mp4,1,The most hated chore that I really don't like doing is folding the laundry. it's like I'm bored with it and and if I can only get somebody else to do it I would definitely delegate it to that person I find it boring I find it time consuming I find it frustrating every time I would lose a pair for example for socks or for the small small items in the laundry so that's it that's the most hated chore that I don't like doing at all
Videos/82690/Visite_1/82690_Question_7_2024-11-14_16-06-25_Video.mp4,1,This is not so much a one-time event, but I've really been wanting to take some time to lose some weight. Just with how busy life has been and how stressed, I feel like my eating habits and exercise habits have not been good. I know I'd be a little bit happier, definitely healthier, just in general feel a lot better. If I did that, I'd just been putting it off. Really kind of, yeah, just lack of the motivation to do it. So that's where I need to start is find some motivation. But that's what I've been avoiding and why I haven't done it.
Videos/82603/Visite_1/82603_Question_5_2024-11-01_23-51-55_Video-DESKTOP-NQ55E0P.mp4,1,I would always like to watch a YouTube video or some kind of entertainment video music to listen to music any time of the day I'm happy to do that I want to do that whether it be I can even be some learning videos from the YouTube or even some entertainment movies TV shows trailers whatever you know content from the influencers something fun to watch with friends at work or home I'm always watching those kind of stuff

They're very tough to stop and I definitely feel guilty after I finish the bag.
Videos/82814/Visite_1/82814_Question_3_2025-01-31_19-29-01_Video.mp4,0,I don't like to do the dishes because it's very repetitive

Here in British Columbia, we have like a tiered system and I'm just on the first tier, which is the learner's one. So I've done all the written tests and I can drive, but there are several restrictions and I kind of been putting off getting the full license because the process is fairly difficult and if I were successful, it wouldn't change my life too much. I mean, I live near SkyTrain station, so I have good access to transit.
Videos/82759/Visite_1/82759_Question_5_2024-12-03_18-55-58_Video.mp4,0,I am almost always willing to go out for coffee with friends.

Videos/82908/Visite_1/82908_Question_6_2025-02-28_12-24-21_Video.mp4,1,That would probably be have a regular nine to five job with a boss. I've been doing that most of my life, but for the last five to 10 years, I've been an independent worker, finding ways to make money by myself and be my own boss, which is far less stress and way more fun.
Videos/82581/Visite_1/82581_Question_3_2024-10-02 16-17-30_Video.mp4,1,I don't like cleaning the kitchen counters and cabinets because we and sinks because we have hard water and I find it instead of satisfying it's a little frustrating because it's hard to get things as clean and sparkling as I would like.

Videos/82704/Visite_1/82704_Question_3_2024-11-18_13-35-43_Video.mp4,1,well every day I after I wake up I jump on my exercise bike and I do 10 miles it's not a particularly exciting thing to do it's boring as hell I try to watch something on the laptop just to help pass the time the reason I do it is because I'm getting on an age where I have to work out because you know middle age spread I just want to prevent things getting worse course.

That is the one that comes to mind quickly about something people around me do but I would never do. Yeah, that's probably it. I just don't see the point of it and I find it quite unhealthy probably. So yeah, I wouldn't do it with my friends at work or at home.

Videos/82575/Visite_1/82575_Question_2_2024-10-02 16-03-51_Video.mp4,1,I think my favorite activity that brings me joy is camping. I love to travel. We have a fifth wheel trailer and we like to go out to campgrounds, especially provincial or state parks, parks that have lakes on them. Got to hook it up to the electricity and really enjoy kind of a home away from home. Again because I'm retired we like to spend a few days longer than most people would on a camping trip, so maybe four or five days at a campsite before we come back. It's very relaxing. It gets you away from everything going on at home, gets you away from your daily chores, and there's just nothing to not like about it. It's just a terrific way to spend some time and I really, really hope to take some extended trips now that I'm in retirement and have the time to do so. But it really, really is enjoyable. It's unfortunate that I live in a place that's, you know, cold for more than six months of the year and can't enjoy this all year round, But we're hoping to take some trips down south and escape the winter as well. So yeah more the more I do the better
Videos/82718/Visite_1/82718_Question_2_2024-11-18_22-27-31_Video.mp4,1,So in the previous question, I kind of already talked a bit about cooking, so I want to reuse my answer.

But yeah, that's something I wish that I could have gotten done by now. I think I'm just waiting for the moment, really, because it's not about the time. Thank you.
Videos/82652/Visite_1/82652_Question_6_2024-11-13_07-43-48_Video.mp4,0,Okay for this one I'm gonna use my husband as an example. So my husband is in the infantry I would and then I worked at infantry battalions for I think seven years in total. I would not be willing to do their job. And then just like the amount that their body goes through, their training that they go through, the aggression, all that fun stuff. I would not be able to do that. I really can not condemn them. I really like, what's the word, when you're really proud. I can't think of the word, but I'm really thankful for them that they're willing to do that because I am not. It's hard. The hours that they put into it, the sleep that they lose, the sacrifices they make. Being in the infantry is a knot for the week of heart. I've learned that one.

I think that I should not watch near as much just because they're so gossipy and so over the top dramatic and they're just really not great shows for, you know, just promoting, you know, good society and good civility. but they, I use them as a good mental break after a stressful day at work, but they're really not great for, um, yeah, they're really gossipy and really awful shows.

Particularly, I don't like to carry all the laundry from our bedroom, which is all the way upstairs, all the way down to the basement. I only have one laundry basket. and it gets very full and so it's a bit challenging to carry it all the way downstairs to where the washing machine and dryer are located.
Videos/82656/Visite_1/82656_Question_3_2024-11-13_11-23-35_Video.mp4,1,A chore that I hate to do, it is actually a chore that I have to do daily. Don't really like doing the dishes. I always have to do it because I'm always cooking. I love to cook, which I really do enjoy doing, but I hate, I absolutely hate doing dishes because there's just so many, especially when you cook all the time. It's just something that just continues to pile up. Doing dishes, you know, at least once a day, if not more, depending on what I'm cooking. So I just find it so boring and annoying because all I just do is just stare at the dishes and wash them.
Videos/82690/Visite_1/82690_Question_1_2024-11-14_15-59-59_Video.mp4,0,so after I wake up well usually my wake-up call I do have some young children and it's usually one of them crying ready to for daddy to come get them so that's usually my first activity now when I am given a moment I usually just take a moment to look at my phone to just caught up to date with any notifications I do have like a bedtime mode on so I don't get notifications after a certain point at night so anything I miss that window I will check that and then yeah go to some breakfast but really i guess the first thing i do is is to get my kid right away because that's usually what's happening but if that doesn't count as an activity i'd say checking my phone

Being with my friends is something I will usually always make time for. If someone's like, hey, let's do a board game night, I'm down. Hey, let's do a movie night, I'm down. That's one thing too, is I love watching movies, especially with my wife. We have such a great time talking about them. A lot of my hobbies and joys I will always make the time for generally. That's usually my problem, though, is I don't have much time for anything else.
Videos/82730/Visite_1/82730_Question_3_2024-11-19_20-51-36_Video.mp4,1,I would say I'm not the biggest fan of doing the dishes, just because a lot of the times different I'll have to wear gloves because the soap will kind of dry out my hands, which is definitely annoying and not something that would be ideal to have dried out hands after doing an activity. So that's probably the main reason why I'd find it. I find it more annoying than boring. I think it's actually, there's nothing too boring about it. It's kind of relaxing, but it's just annoying that the activity causes that.
Videos/82819/Visite_1/82819_Question_1_2025-02-01_11-44-07_Video.mp4,0,I usually have a shower

I've seen her now, it's been close to 10 years. So I've been wanting to see her but every time I put it off because of other engagements.

So seeing my grandma is what I think I should do, but I haven't done yet. But I would like to do it in the future.
Videos/82603/Visite_1/82603_Question_4_2024-11-01_23-50-07_Video-DESKTOP-NQ55E0P.mp4,1,I like most people love social media but I don't want to you know waste my time on it like I can use it for our five to ten minutes that's fine but when I keep using it more than ten minutes like 20 30 minutes it it's kind of frustrating I don't want to do but I keep doing it most of the time and I don't like that at all like it's it's kind of frustrating and you know having a grip on me that's suffering for me so I don't want to do that but I keep doing the doing I keep doing that
Videos/82633/Visite_1/82633_Question_1_2024-11-06_15-28-28_Video.mp4,0,So yeah, usually right after I wake up, I take my morning medications, my puffer, my morning pills, and just to make sure I don't forget to do that.
Videos/82701/Visite_1/82701_Question_3_2024-11-18_12-12-10_Video.mp4,1,One of the activities I don't like to do is like doing laundry. I find it exhausting. I'd rather pay someone or buy a washing machine to do that. That's why I find it boring or annoying since it takes most of my time, which I could have done something productive.
Videos/82656/Visite_1/82656_Question_5_2024-11-13_11-21-51_Video.mp4,1,I'm almost always willing to play video games. I don't play enough of them currently. I don't have the time and my wife doesn't enjoy playing them. She just can't handle the controls but I'm always willing to do that all the time with friends at work, at home if the opportunity presented itself, especially at work.
Videos/82641/Visite_1/82641_Question_1_2024-11-11_11-30-43_Video.mp4,0,After I wake up, I usually immediately go on my computer to check if I missed any emails, notifications, and stuff to do with work.
Videos/82908/Visite_1/82908_Question_2_2025-02-28_12-20-38_Video.mp4,1,That for me would be playing hockey out on the ice with equipment and everything. It's a great time to socialize with friends, good exercise, and it's my favorite sport. So it definitely is one of the things that gives me a lot of joy.
Videos/82599/Visite_1/82599_Question_5_2024-11-01_18-42-19_Video.mp4,0,I'm quite willing to clean up the house just to make it nice and clean so that my wife, when she comes home, she doesn't have much of a mess to deal with and also prepare the dinner for the night.
Videos/82718/Visite_1/82718_Question_1_2024-11-18_22-24-22_Video.mp4,0,So the first thing I like to do after waking up is usually make the bed because I read there's evidence to suggest that if you start your day with something productive, then that kind of you get off on the right foot and it carries over the rest of the day. After that, I do the normal stuff like, you know, showering and doing the whole morning routine. And then it depends after it depends. Like sometimes I go to work. Sometimes I might clean up a bit around the house or run some errands. but I usually like to at least leave the house and walk around for at least 15 minutes, get a bit active.
Videos/82588/Visite_1/82588_Question_1_2024-10-02 16-10-04_Video.mp4,0,After waking up, I brush my teeth, comb my hair, wash my face, moisturize my skin.
Videos/82723/Visite_1/82723_Question_4_2024-11-19_13-45-33_Video.mp4,0,My wife thinks I like too much sex. So, it's not a guilty pleasure. I like this stuff. But more control, I suppose.
Videos/82913/Visite_1/82913_Question_2_2025-03-01_19-07-32_Video.mp4,0,I love to watch movies. It's really relaxing and I don't have to think. And I'm not too, I guess, distracted.
Videos/82690/Visite_1/82690_Question_6_2024-11-14_16-05-28_Video.mp4,1,So something that people around me like doing, I don't know if you're still thinking of leisure and hobbies type thing but that's kind of what's on my mind. I enjoy listening to music but making music so mainly singing I'm not a fan of at all. I actually have some like I'd call it anxiety around that area there and I have quite a few friends that are pretty big into music. They're just doing like little jam sessions or whatever it may be or I do participate in like I go to church or other places too where singing is a part of it I personally do not participate in there in the activity I just yeah just don't like it it scares me makes me a little anxious so that's something I don't do even though people around me do do it
Videos/82642/Visite_1/82642_Question_2_2024-11-11_14-48-05_Video.mp4,0,The activity that brings me joy is just working with my hands. So like some carpentry or plumbing or just doing things around the house using tools and everything. It seems like it's very satisfying to see what you build afterwards and how it can be improved upon and doing the best you can to make something you might use for everyday use. But yeah, that's why I enjoy it.
Videos/82904/Visite_1/82904_Question_6_2025-02-27_09-29-31_Video.mp4,0,something some people do around me is commit to plans, whether those are social activities or others, in quite a spontaneous last minute way. And that's something that I'm not willing to do just because I prefer to have some routine and be able to foresee how my day and how my week is going to shake out. So committing to activities in a more spontaneous way is something that I'm usually not willing to do.
Videos/82662/Visite_1/82662_Question_5_2024-11-13_12-51-44_Video.mp4,1,Something that I'm almost always willing to do is cook. I like cooking, especially supper. I enjoy making meals for my family, making meals for friends. I find it an enjoyable experience.
Videos/82590/Visite_1/82590_Question_7_2024-10-02 16-24-54_Video.mp4,1,So I've put off writing letters to my family to send back home because I'd have to write so many letters because I have all my sisters, my mum, my dad and I separately and then my grandparents. So I've really been putting that off. I'll probably do it soon, but I really need to get that started. And I'd say I've put off like studying, learning stuff new maybe. And sometimes I put off like job searching cause I just find it so frustrating. Like I've applied to hundreds of jobs and I just have to keep applying over and over just to never hear back. so I really put that off because it makes me feel kind of really bad but I will get round that it's just no not good um yeah so I need to write more I need to maybe sometimes I put off tidying up as well which is bad it's not none of this is good
Videos/82723/Visite_1/82723_Question_3_2024-11-19_13-47-30_Video.mp4,1,Uh, I had to think about this one. I don't really have any chores that I don't like doing. However, I don't like cooking because it's a lot of work. My wife usually does the cooking. She would like me to do more of it. I've made an attempt, but it doesn't taste as good as hers and it's just a lot of work for me at least.
Videos/82701/Visite_1/82701_Question_5_2024-11-18_12-13-56_Video.mp4,1,One of the activities that I'm willing to do with friends at work or at home is like going for a bike ride. I like riding motorcycles, like being in a motorcycle racing team. That's what I do with friends when I'm free or when I'm not at work. Other stuff that I can do with friends at home or at work is like playing soccer. I like football. That's what I always do every day when I'm not at work.
Videos/82589/Visite_1/82589_Question_7_2024-10-02 16-13-31_Video.mp4,1,One thing I've been putting off and haven't done yet is actually a project I have to do. It's an assignment for schoolwork. I have to meet with my group members and discuss the logistics of the project and split up the roles and parts. But I haven't quite done it yet, mainly because I've just been swamped with so much work and it's really hard to get started on something that I don't really want to do.
Videos/82789/Visite_1/82789_Question_1_2024-12-13_00-02-52_Video.mp4,0,After waking up, I drink a glass of water to hydrate myself and refresh me, and then I do a quick stretch to ease into the day. Finally, I plan my tasks and prepare breakfast to start the morning night.
Videos/82750/Visite_1/82750_Question_5_2024-11-28_01-13-30_Video.mp4,1,An activity that I'm almost always willing to do is go out for food or dinner. I rarely pass up on that. If anybody asks me to do that, I'm gonna go, be it a co-worker or a friend or family, whomever.
Videos/82678/Visite_1/82678_Question_4_2024-11-13_23-19-44_Video.mp4,1,I eat too much junk food. It's not very healthy. I'd like to stop it. Or, not stop, but cut back a little.
Videos/82647/Visite_1/82647_Question_3_2024-11-12_19-02-54_Video.mp4,0,I don't like to do laundry because of how long it takes, simply because it takes an hour between the cycles and then I can't leave the house. I can't start any activity that would take more than an hour and I always have to be paying attention, at least a little bit as well. It's noisy, so it takes, it's hard to concentrate.
Videos/82751/Visite_1/82751_Question_1_2024-11-28_01-39-44_Video.mp4,0,After waking up, I typically immediately start my day with a shower, which lasts about 5-10 minutes. I find that this is really important for my hair care and ensuring that it is not very dandruffy during the day.

I think I really enjoy it because I like watching movies and shows, but I want to stop because I just feel unproductive when I do it. And like I feel like I should be doing something better with my time. Yeah, so probably that.
Videos/82642/Visite_1/82642_Question_6_2024-11-11_14-46-10_Video.mp4,0,Something people around me do is drink lots of alcohol or take part in recreational drugs or go to concerts and parties. However, that is not something I would probably take a part of. I don't find it enjoyable the way others do. and yeah it seems like to me at least it doesn't seem like a way to spend my time enjoyably which is why it is something I would not to but yeah
Videos/82647/Visite_1/82647_Question_7_2024-11-12_19-01-17_Video.mp4,1,I've been thinking about writing a book. This book would be based off of what I currently study in my free time, which is to do with Islamic history. The reason I haven't started is there's always new things that I'm learning, so I feel like maybe I should keep waiting. And then in the end, I end up keep waiting and I keep learning new things and I'm putting off my own book.
Videos/82661/Visite_1/82661_Question_7_2024-11-13_12-44-18_Video.mp4,1,I recently got laid off and there's a new job that's coming available. I'm just about finished my school.

If somebody's dealing with some challenges, I'm more than happy and willing to listen and provide solutions if that's what they're looking for or just provide an open ear if that's what they need. That's something that I'm never too busy to not take that role. I've needed that support from friends and family in the past, and I'm more than willing to provide that to anybody else.

Also I feel like I'm doing something useful with my time so that's why I really enjoy it.

It can be anywhere from five to 25 minutes late. I live in Canada too. So when it starts to get cold, that can be super difficult. Just sort of standing in one place and there's people smoking cigarettes around you. A lot of the times at the bus stop, you know, there might be just people you don't want to talk to. Or there could be a multitude of things. being late to an appointment because the bus was late or being late to work because the bus was late, just being stressed out over the entire thing. It's really not it.

I've been to other continents, North America, South America, as well as Europe, but I've never been to Asia before. So that's definitely a place on my bucket list that I want to go to. I'm putting it off probably because it's quite expensive to travel there and it hasn't been a top priority for me.

I always push back on doing moisturizing and stuff like that. underneath the whole perception of guys normally don't do that kind of thing.

Also because of the cost of the sport, it does affect my commitments. It just brings a deep joy to me, the smile that you get after a proper slide. That gives me a lot of joy.

While I do get out on my bike, I would like to build a daily practice where I'm working out, lifting weights, doing body weight exercises, going for a jog, something similar. I walk, I walk with my dog, I ride my bike with my kids and on my own, but it's not as frequent as I would like. And that's something that really, there's no excuse. I'm working from home most of the time. It's easy to take 30 seconds and do a set of pushups. It's just something that I struggle making part of my regular part of my day.

I am a self-published author and I write in my spare time. And I've had a book idea in my head for a while that I've been putting off writing because I just can't find the energy for it. I really want to write it and I get really great ideas and I write them down and then I come to do it and realize that I just don't have the mental energy to do them. So I'm kind of stuck.
Videos/82812/Visite_1/82812_Question_7_2025-01-31_19-11-53_Video.mp4,1,So one of the projects that I've been trying to do at home is take all my photos, or digital photos, and put it in, or sort through them. For example, get rid of multiples, or when you take a photo you take multiple pictures and then you never end up looking at any of them because there's so much content. So I'm trying to get all the photos from my phone, my computer, maybe like Facebook or Instagram, my husband's photos and try to put them all together and then sort them by time and location or whatever and then pare them down. So then I haven't gotten to that yet, even though we've been saying it for maybe a few months.
Videos/82663/Visite_1/82663_Question_1_2024-11-13_14-51-17_Video.mp4,0,First thing I usually do is go to the washroom, brush my teeth. Usually I'll go on the internet, read some articles. Maybe I'll play a video game for a bit just to kind of get my brain started. And then I get ready for work. I sometimes work remote, so my workstation's all here. So after I'm good to go, I start working. usually have breakfast too and some coffee as well.

You get to meet new people, you get to collaborate with new people. And as well, scoring, making your strategies work. It's very, very fun. You also get that runner's high after the workout. It's very intense. It just makes you feel better overall.

She's waiting for the moment every day and when she sees that I wake up, she comes to me, gets on my chest and lays down. Sometimes she has her left paw on my chin, my mouth, or my nose.
Videos/82554/Visite_1/82554_Question_6_2024-08-22 12-18-13_Video.mp4,0,At work, I find some people are very quick to dismiss the feelings of their direct reports when they make changes. They feel like they should, as management, we should be entitled to make whatever decisions we want. And the feelings of the people that we're asking to make these changes and do these jobs don't matter. Personally, I don't like being managed that way. I like being part of the change. I like being part of the discussion leading into it. And so I don't like to put my reports in that same position. I find that you get better results by involving the people directly and explaining why things are happening. At the very least, walking them through it, even though it may not be a popular decision, it makes them feel more valued as opposed to just arbitrarily dumping things on people's heads. Again, I don't like being treated that way, so I try not to treat my direct reports that way.
Videos/82743/Visite_1/82743_Question_7_2024-11-27_18-10-13_Video.mp4,1,So something I haven't done that I should have done is returned some of the clothes I bought that doesn't fit. But I haven't done so because it is very bothersome and I don't have the time or energy to do it. So it's just been sitting in my house. I should return it because I spend money on it, but I just haven't come around to it.

So every time I get invited to a restaurant to go get a snack, a meal, I'm always on the go. Same thing for going out to get a drink. I love going out with friends, going to the club, partying. at the moment. I'm still going for that. I also like calmer evenings. I have friends who are artists who have drawing, painting, etc. parties. I never say no either. And I would also say an activity that I do a lot is ... I have friends who play Dungeons & Dragons. So I play that once in a while. It's cool.
Videos/82787/Visite_1/82787_Question_6_2024-12-12_21-47-54_Video.mp4,0,My friends tend to gamble on sports, on esports and such things but I don't. I won't.

And I really want to take some sort of martial arts again. You know, I think it'd be nice to know how to defend yourself and give you some confidence in interactions.
Videos/82620/Visite_1/82620_Question_3_2024-11-05_15-01-20_Video.mp4,1,An activity that I don't like to do would be cooking, not because I don't know how, just because I find it boring. So I tend to cook something that people find really delicious, but then since I'm the one that cooked it, I oftentimes don't have an appetite for it. So as a result of that, I'm constantly seeking for, you know, varieties of food. And that makes me to, you know, go to different restaurants in order to get this food. So overall, I would consider cooking to be very boring or annoying. And in as much as it's a skill that everyone should possess, I think it's sometimes a waste of time. Yeah.
Videos/82658/Visite_1/82658_Question_6_2024-11-13_11-54-42_Video.mp4,0,Some of my friends, they usually go to the casino and they gamble. And they sometimes invite me along, but I'm not the type of person who wants to go to a casino and gamble money. Just because in the past I've always lost money. And it's something that I do not look forward to.
Videos/82650/Visite_1/82650_Question_6_2024-11-13_00-36-58_Video.mp4,0,forgetting my values or working around that my values that even though doing some things that are going against my values is something that I'm not willing to do even others do around me the yeah that is one thing I believe
Videos/82575/Visite_1/82575_Question_7_2024-10-02 16-05-26_Video.mp4,1,I think one thing I always wanted to do that I've been putting off and probably will never do, there's a community west of where I live. It's in the forest. It's just to the base of the mountains, the Rocky Mountains. And I really always wanted to live there. It's within a half-hour drive from the city where I live. Beautiful, beautiful spot. It's a little expensive. But had I moved out there or had our family moved out there several years ago when prices were not as crazy as they are now, we probably would have enjoyed it. We probably would still be out there. But we never made that move. We were a little bit too timid, I suppose, to do it, to raise the kids in a totally different atmosphere than what we're used to. So that has never happened. And now with prices as crazy as they are, there's no way we can afford to do it. So, yeah, I kind of regret not doing it. And I put it off to the point where it's too late. Thank you.
Videos/82584/Visite_1/82584_Question_1_2024-10-02 16-09-14_Video.mp4,1,I usually prepare what I'm supposed to do during the day and plan ahead so that I can continue whatever I'm supposed to do.
Videos/82890/Visite_1/82890_Question_2_2025-02-25_15-25-40_Video.mp4,1,Well, a hobby that brings me joy is photography. I like photography because I'm able to take a capture of an image that I can return to or share with friends or the world. And being able to freeze a moment in time, I think is exciting. It's an exciting thing to do. And not only freezing that moment, but being able to return to that moment that was frozen is even more exciting. That's why I like photography and that's why I like taking photos.
Videos/82572/Visite_1/82572_Question_2_2024-10-02 16-04-15_Video.mp4,1,A hobby that gives me joy, that I'm thrilled to do all the time is watching a movie.

Our vacuum cleaner is very big, very noisy, and it annoys me to have to pass it because I have a lot of things on the floor and I have to enough otherwise where do I find the worst of the worst is all the curves that take into account the cold so go snowing my car is really the worst thing I can do in the world I hate and even just go in my car when it is cold and wait for it to warm up to see go outside in winter when it is cold it is really la pire des choses.

Videos/82792/Visite_1/82792_Question_3_2024-12-14_13-58-08_Video.mp4,0,We recently had to clean out the gutters of the house that we live in and that's one I don't like. It's dirty, gross, awkward, up on a ladder. It's really annoying to get your hand in the gutter to pull out all the moss and the dirt. It's just rather tedious and that's what makes it annoying.
Videos/82684/Visite_1/82684_Question_5_2024-11-14_10-55-56_Video.mp4,1,I really enjoy eating food. So that's something that I'm always willing to do with friends or at work and at home.

I just find it really tedious and quite time consuming. You have to first put it in the washing machine and then dry it, takes time, and then you have to fold it. I just think it's really tedious, but you have to do it. Yeah, so it's a chore that I don't really like doing, but you have to do. and mostly because it's just boring and time consuming.
Videos/82603/Visite_1/82603_Question_1_2024-11-01_23-46-28_Video.mp4,1,well after waking up I'll first check my phone I know that's not very healthy but I check my messages and any important things to do on the day and then I proceed to brushing my teeth and you know using the washroom and then going to the gym that's the whole process after just after waking up

I drink a bit, but I don't like to get to the point where my friends or people around me do in terms of getting really, really drunk. It gets quite, yeah, it's a waste of time really. And I don't feel like being sick all the time, rather expensive too. So anyways, yeah, people do that around me and I don't do that. I certainly wouldn't be willing to do that with people from work. I see no point to doing that with people at home. Maybe with friends I'll go out and drink but not the way they do. Yeah.
Videos/82725/Visite_1/82725_Question_6_2024-11-19_15-13-09_Video.mp4,1,I know quite a few people, friends, family, co-workers who all smoke cigarettes, and that is something I would not be willing to do.

Videos/82730/Visite_1/82730_Question_4_2024-11-19_20-52-51_Video.mp4,1,An activity that I might want to stop is binging very awful TV shows and shows that are so bad that they're addicting to watch. And I think I do that a lot where I'll watch a show and then just keep watching it even though it's not necessarily good and sink a lot of time into that even though the show isn't necessarily something that's very high quality or something that I would be interested in telling others about or that I would admit to others that I watch. and so I think that's a little bit of a time waster and kind of like a guilty pleasure that I think that I enjoy but I would like to stop.
Videos/82601/Visite_1/82601_Question_7_2024-11-01_20-20-06_Video-DESKTOP-NQ55E0P.mp4,1,Something that I've been continuously putting off is making YouTube videos on topics that I've learned about, specifically on areas that I do my research in. So I think that will help me both learn as well as make a presence that would one day help me when choosing a career. So I think doing YouTube videos on my research would be something, it is something that I keep putting off because it takes time to not only get everything set up but it takes time to have a proper routine, get planned for everything. And because of that I usually keep putting it off for later.
