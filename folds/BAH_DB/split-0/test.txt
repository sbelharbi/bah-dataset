Videos/82711/Visite_1/82711_Question_1_2024-11-18_16-07-42_Video.mp4,1,Hello? Usually when I wake up, first thing is, honestly, go on the phone a little bit. And then in the washroom, I'll do a number two, I suppose. And then take a shower, and then brush, and then, you know, get dressed, go downstairs. So order is, check the phone, which maybe that's not the greatest thing. And then in the washroom, poop, shower, and brush. In that order.
Videos/82711/Visite_1/82711_Question_2_2024-11-18_16-09-44_Video.mp4,1,I like playing video games, so it's probably my preferred way to engage with media, engage with art. Usually single player games with good stories, that kind of stuff. That's the reason I like them. It's because you can get an experience from them. Whereas more arcade-y games, just like whatever shooter is popular, I don't think those are as engaging mentally. Or at least they're not going to provide some type of story or something like that. Something else, I recently started reading books again after quite a while. And it makes you feel productive. I also go to the gym. That makes me feel very productive as well, which is one of the reasons I like those things because it feels like you're doing something good for yourself, I suppose.
Videos/82711/Visite_1/82711_Question_3_2024-11-18_16-08-43_Video.mp4,1,So I do my laundry and then my, what's the word, my clothes, once I folded them and finished them up, they will be in the hamper for a while because I don't know, it's just hard. It's not hard, it's a hassle to take the folded clothes and put them back in the drawers. So I probably did my laundry like a week ago already and then it's still upstairs just in the hamper. All the clothes are folded. Honestly, I could just pick the clothes up from that hamper itself, but it's probably better to put it in my drawers. Yeah, it's just a hassle. I don't know why it's so annoying or so boring.
Videos/82711/Visite_1/82711_Question_4_2024-11-18_16-11-13_Video.mp4,1,This one's kind of hard. Took a while to think about it. I would have said reading, but that's something I just started. So in terms of something I don't do but would like to do, if I did this survey like a week ago, two weeks ago, I would have said reading books, but I guess not able to say that. I would not want to stop video games, even though a lot of people think that might be an unproductive habit. I think it's not a guilty pleasure for me. It's like something good. I would probably say I had something I forgot I would probably say phone time screen time and just phone time especially in the evening like in bed basically and like I mentioned especially in the morning when I wake up I probably shouldn't be looking at my phone first thing in the morning so I would say that in terms of something I would like to stop Thank you.
Videos/82711/Visite_1/82711_Question_5_2024-11-18_16-13-21_Video.mp4,1,I think it's small favors if somebody asks like hey can you grab this or like uh I don't know is there there's an errand that they have to do and they're like hey can you just grab that from the store or something or can you reach the shelf uh small things like that for sure I'm down um and then secondly um I try making it a point to uh whenever somebody invites me to something go to those things because you're just keeping friends with people from work people uh not work primarily but your friends otherwise if you don't see them very often I mean are you guys really friends and then even at work um i think opening yourself up saying yes to more things gives you more opportunities uh to meet people make connections so in terms of what i'm always willing to do um say yes to you know going places or saying yes to invites whenever i get received
Videos/82711/Visite_1/82711_Question_6_2024-11-18_16-15-06_Video.mp4,1,I'm trying to fix this about myself, but I feel like I'm very practical slash, I don't know what the word would be, utilitarian, I guess. If something's kind of pointless, I can't really think of an example. I'll probably not do it, or at least if I'm going to do it, I will question like, hey, what is the point of this? But honestly, the point is that it's probably enjoyable. It's probably conducive to building a relationship. But if it's going to be unnecessary spending of money to do it, it's going to be unnecessary spending of time or just effort putting in, I'm less willing to do those things unless there's a good reason for that. But again, that's something I'm already kind of working on. Like I mentioned in the last thing about accepting invites, wherever that may be, even if nowadays I don't think it's super practical, I'll still try going. But that's something I need to get better at.
Videos/82711/Visite_1/82711_Question_7_2024-11-18_16-12-03_Video.mp4,1,So I'm doing a teaching program. So about a year from now, I will be a licensed teacher, high school teacher in BC. In my class that I have this semester, we're supposed to do a portfolio, which is going to be like a 50 page for myself. It's going to be a PowerPoint, like a 50 page PowerPoint, basically describing my experience so far. I probably should have started on that already, but I just simply haven't. But I'll get around to it soon. So I'm not too worried about it. But yeah, I've been putting that off for sure.
Videos/82729/Visite_1/82729_Question_1_2024-11-19_19-40-18_Video.mp4,0,An activity that I usually do after waking up is check my phone. I check my phone for emails that I may have missed or sometimes I'll reply to those emails. Also messages, text messages, social media messages, just replying to those. Also just scrolling through social media and catching up on things that I may have missed. Also just checking the news as well, sometimes I do that. Checking my local newspaper website, that's what I do. you know scroll through my phone so that's something I usually do after waking up
Videos/82729/Visite_1/82729_Question_2_2024-11-19_19-46-49_Video.mp4,0,Yeah, an activity that brings me joy is definitely watching hockey. I love, love watching hockey, ice hockey in particular. It brings me a lot of joy. It's just like you're connected by a community of hockey fans and just being able to watch people skate really fast on ice and shoot the puck. It's just so amazing just to watch the talent there is when watching hockey, for sure. It's just so remarkable to see all the talent on the ice and seeing people be happy and seeing all the emotions involved in the talent.
Videos/82729/Visite_1/82729_Question_3_2024-11-19_19-45-49_Video.mp4,1,um an activity i don't like doing or that kind of boring or annoying is probably um like let me think actually sorry probably um like putting clothes back um after doing laundry and putting clothes back it's just it's so hard especially like trying to organize your clothes in a way that's organized in your closet but you also like want to organize it before putting in the closet there's just so much organization involved and it's so annoying to like pull their clothes and put their clothes back especially like because my closet's kind of hard to access so um yeah probably just like organizing clothes after washing them just like organizing clothes in general
Videos/82729/Visite_1/82729_Question_4_2024-11-19_19-47-58_Video.mp4,1,And then activate how you don't do but like do is probably just, um, my first thought was work out. But I think the second one is probably more important, which is putting on my night guard before I sleep. I should probably put on my night guard, which protects my teeth, but I don't do it because it's just so annoying to wear. And it just makes falling asleep harder because you're bothered by the thing in your mouth. So is that an activity? I don't think that's enough to be so never mind. I changed my mind. And that's to me, I don't do what I would like to do is probably be a workout because it's just like exercise in general because it's good for your health and I would love to start exercising more. So workout at the gym.
Videos/82729/Visite_1/82729_Question_5_2024-11-19_19-43-01_Video.mp4,1,An activity that I'm always willing to do is probably just eat food. I'm always willing to grab some food with friends. And if my friend invites me to go out for dinner or whatever, or even a coworker at work wants to eat lunch with me, or someone wants to cook food for me at home or whatever, it's always a yes. I'm always willing to eat. I feel like we all need to eat, so food is pretty important, right? So I'm always willing to eat. all circumstances because it's important to eat.
Videos/82729/Visite_1/82729_Question_6_2024-11-19_19-41-56_Video.mp4,0,Um, something that people around me might do would be probably like smoking cigarettes and taking drugs, hard drugs. That's something that I would not be willing to do. Yeah, I know. I just, I think that other people might be, other people around me might be interested in or might be okay with smoking cigarettes or taking drugs and that's not something that I'm interested in doing with friends or coworkers or with family or whatever. I just feel like it's not that great for my health and I've just never had an interest in it and I know that it's harmful. Just trying to be health conscious.
Videos/82729/Visite_1/82729_Question_7_2024-11-19_19-44-23_Video.mp4,1,um there's multiple reasons why i haven't done that yet but probably apply for jobs and like look for a job it's something that i could have done by now but haven't done yet and i've been putting it off and haven't decided on yet because there's um multiple things in my way there's things that i want to do first and things i want to explore before you know being stuck in a job and you know but at the same time though I've been putting it off because it's stressful for sure but it's something that I definitely could have done by now for sure it's just, it's a lot right, and putting yourself out there is always stressful
Videos/82593/Visite_1/82593_Question_1_2024-10-02 16-19-36_Video-DESKTOP-NQ55E0P.mp4,0,After waking up, I make coffee, I take the dog for a walk, and then I drink my coffee.
Videos/82593/Visite_1/82593_Question_2_2024-10-02 16-27-50_Video-DESKTOP-NQ55E0P.mp4,0,I'm traveling because I enjoy meeting new people from different cultures and experiencing different cultures and the food and the life-changing experiences that travel brings.
Videos/82593/Visite_1/82593_Question_3_2024-10-02 16-29-13_Video.mp4,1,I'm vacuuming and any kind of cleaning because I just hate doing it because it's hard and it's annoying and it's tiring and it's not fulfilling.
Videos/82593/Visite_1/82593_Question_4_2024-10-02 16-28-38_Video-DESKTOP-NQ55E0P.mp4,1,I need to stop eating so much junk food especially ice cream but I'm addicted to sugar and so I eat too much crap even though I exercise a lot I still eat too much crap so I still have a tummy that I want to get rid of but I can't because I eat too much crap
Videos/82593/Visite_1/82593_Question_5_2024-10-02 16-21-02_Video-DESKTOP-NQ55E0P.mp4,0,Eat.
Videos/82593/Visite_1/82593_Question_6_2024-10-02 16-20-28_Video.mp4,0,I can't think of anything to be honest. Nothing's coming to my head. So I can't answer this question. I'm sorry about that.
Videos/82593/Visite_1/82593_Question_7_2024-10-02 16-27-07_Video-DESKTOP-NQ55E0P.mp4,1,um i need to renovate our kitchen but i haven't done it yet because i know it's going to be expensive and i don't really have the money right now
Videos/82748/Visite_1/82748_Question_1_2024-11-28_00-06-30_Video.mp4,0,Wow, that's quite an interesting question. So about the activity I usually do waking up, it centers on family activities. And why do I say so? I have three kids and so immediately I wake up, the first thing is to start dressing them up from school, to bathe them, make sure they brush their teeth. And then secondly, I move straight to the kitchen. Of course, the kids cannot go to the school without having something to eat like snacks and the rest where I go down to make breakfast for them and also for lunch that they are going to take to school so it's quite a busy activity early in the morning because I still have to like tidy up and do all sorts of things too after they have left to school so that's quite interesting activity and then I think after that most times I go to the gym so these are like most of the regular activities I do once I wake up so the kids preparing them for school and then going to gym that's it thank you
Videos/82748/Visite_1/82748_Question_2_2024-11-28_00-12-55_Video.mp4,1,Yeah, one activity or a hobby that brings me joy is traveling. I love to travel. I love to travel a lot, either with kids or solo travel like just me or me and my friends. I love to travel a lot because in fact, I set it as a goal that I want to go to almost all the countries here in the world. And I know that might not be possible, but of course, I'm really working on it, right? I love to travel a lot. I love to make new friends. I love to try out new food. I just love to explore to see what other countries have. And of recent, not of recent anyway, like I've actually covered some countries like China. I've been to China. I've been to Vietnam. I've been to South Africa. I've been to Spain, France. I've been to Canada. I've been to a lot of places and I still want to still go to a lot of places and of course this December I am traveling to Mexico so that is one of it so I just love to travel that's quite interesting to me
Videos/82748/Visite_1/82748_Question_3_2024-11-28_00-15-59_Video.mp4,1,I think one activity that I find very boring and annoying is I think two things come to my mind cooking it's the whole lot of work to cook food right in as much as I still do it every day but I find it boring because of the processes required in putting up a dish right it takes actually a lot to put up something good and really good and this is because of the stress and at the same time I think the reason why I hate it is because growing up I was never used to cooking by myself we had chefs we had a lot of people to do it for us and we rarely go into the kitchen so this could be a reason why I don't really fancy cooking in as much as I do but that's it
Videos/82748/Visite_1/82748_Question_4_2024-11-28_00-14-18_Video.mp4,1,One activity that I would like to stop is, I think that should be swimming. I've tried a lot of times to learn how to swim and each time I go into the water, I freak out. Like, I've tried them several times and I think at this point in time, I might be giving up, right? because I am scared of the water I think that's one thing that scares me a lot right I think maybe because of past experience because I have a cousin that I lost in the swimming pool while we were very young and this could be like the reason behind the whole fear I've tried to overcome it but I can't even at this age so something I might let go I I see people swim and I just wish I can swim just like them but unfortunately I can't
Videos/82748/Visite_1/82748_Question_5_2024-11-28_00-09-56_Video.mp4,0,Yeah, there are lots of activities I kind of love to do and that is mostly hanging out with my friends, right? I love to go to restaurants, try out new foods, I love to club, I love to dance. In fact, me and my friends, we always anticipate for the weekend because we call it like a getaway whereby we just get away from husband and kids and just have fun so i always and i'm willing to look forward to these activities with my friend hanging out clubbing dancing that's quite interesting and it actually makes us happy
Videos/82748/Visite_1/82748_Question_6_2024-11-28_00-11-17_Video.mp4,0,Okay, I think one thing that I wouldn't be willing to do is I wouldn't be willing to dress provocatively, right? In as much as I want to have fun, I have boundaries. A lot of people might be okay with exposing their body or something, but this is really something against my religion and I wouldn't want to do that. So and apart from that, something else I'm not willing to do, I'm not willing to gossip, right? In the workspace, there are lots of people who tend to gossip a lot. And I find that non-acceptable and I am not willing to partake in such things.
Videos/82748/Visite_1/82748_Question_7_2024-11-28_00-08-33_Video.mp4,1,Okay, something that I haven't done, for example, something I'm putting off or haven't decided. Okay, I think that should be centered on my MBA. I'm currently an international student here in Canada and it's so hard actually deciding where to actually channel or focus on. I have options of focusing on marketing, options of focusing on human resource after MBA, and several other options, leadership and the rest. So I think this is a bit challenging, but I know that if I'm able to meet with the advising team, right, they can be able to help me make that decision. It's really quite a big decision to make and I look forward to this expertise that school has provided for us to actually help me to make such decisions about my area of specialization after MBA. What to do? I have something for marketing. I'm looking at digital marketing and then I'm also looking at human resource. But until I meet up with them, I can be able to make that decision. This is undecided. I haven't decided this for now.
Videos/82592/Visite_1/82592_Question_1_2024-10-02 16-18-09_Video.mp4,0,What I usually do after waking up is taking care of my daughter. I prepare breakfast for her. I get her out of the bed. I pour some milk for her. So that's all I would say preparation of my child for daycare.
Videos/82592/Visite_1/82592_Question_2_2024-10-02 16-27-23_Video-DESKTOP-NQ55E0P.mp4,0,Biking is my number one hobby. I really love being on my bike, being outside, enduring the sun, the wind when it's more fresh. Being able to go from point A to point B while exercising, losing calories, while seeing beautiful scenery. Sometimes it's a little bit complicated in an urban setting because there are more cars and more cyclists as well but it's a fun activity.
Videos/82592/Visite_1/82592_Question_3_2024-10-02 16-28-10_Video.mp4,1,I really hate folding laundry or having to take the dishes out of the dishwasher once it's done cleaning because I just feel it's such a repetitive and boring task. It's not stimulating. So after a few minutes, I'm already exhausted and bored and I don't feel motivated to keep doing it.
Videos/82592/Visite_1/82592_Question_4_2024-10-02 16-24-34_Video.mp4,1,I would love to stop shopping for brand items and I'm really a shopaholic. I always find a reason to shop whether it's toys for my child or shoes or clothing bags. So I would love to stop doing that.
Videos/82592/Visite_1/82592_Question_5_2024-10-02 16-19-02_Video-DESKTOP-NQ55E0P.mp4,0,I'm always willing to go biking or to do outdoor sports. I really enjoy being outdoors in nature with music. I do enjoy biking solo because it allows me to focus more on the activity and enjoy more nature or the outdoors, the landscape.
Videos/82592/Visite_1/82592_Question_6_2024-10-02 16-23-45_Video.mp4,1,People around me, I would say I have lots of people around me who are in unhappy relationships and they're willing to stay in them because financially they feel like they wouldn't be able to live on their own. And that's not something I think I would be able to do because I feel like it's important to be happy with your partner and be happy in general.
Videos/82592/Visite_1/82592_Question_7_2024-10-02 16-22-36_Video.mp4,1,I definitely have to finish unpacking. I've just recently moved and I have a few boxes left over that I need to unpack and really sort out and get it over with.

Videos/82740/Visite_1/82740_Question_2_2024-11-27_16-15-49_Video.mp4,1,One of my favorite things to do is cooking because I grew up in a family where food was very important to all of us. We've always been sure to eat whole meals, healthy meals, and I just really enjoy making food, enjoying what I'm eating. That's important to me.
Videos/82740/Visite_1/82740_Question_3_2024-11-27_16-17-15_Video.mp4,0,Something I find pretty annoying to do is my bird poops a lot, so I have to clean out his whole mat underneath his cage that often has tons and tons of poop, which nobody wants to touch all that poop.
Videos/82740/Visite_1/82740_Question_4_2024-11-27_16-16-33_Video.mp4,1,An easy example of something along those lines is quitting smoking, something I'd like to do ASAP. Yeah, it's not something I'm happy to be doing, but it is enjoyable.

I can scroll those short videos to make me concentrate on something for some time. sometimes so I can be completely sober.
Videos/82586/Visite_1/82586_Question_2_2024-10-02 16-13-38_Video-DESKTOP-NQ55E0P.mp4,0,An example of an activity that brings me joy would be playing badminton because I always enjoy playing competitive sports. I like the feeling of my adrenaline and I like winning.

Videos/82586/Visite_1/82586_Question_7_2024-10-02 16-16-05_Video-DESKTOP-NQ55E0P.mp4,1,Currently, I'm not very satisfied with the current company that I'm working for. I should have applied for more jobs, but I haven't decided yet because I really like my team right now but I don't like the way my supervisor is doing her work and also I don't like some policies of this company so that's why I'm still thinking about that.
Videos/82777/Visite_1/82777_Question_1_2024-12-07_19-00-52_Video.mp4,1,After waking up, after I get myself ready for the day, the most important thing is to let my dogs out of the house so they can go to the washroom and then feed them. My dogs are 11 and 15 years old, so they have quite a routine with their food and their medication. So it's important that the first thing I do is care for their needs after my initial going to the washroom.
Videos/82777/Visite_1/82777_Question_2_2024-12-07_19-04-28_Video.mp4,1,A hobby of mine that I love doing is using my Cricut, a machine that will cut, well paper, but in my sense vinyl and then iron on vinyl that I use to make t-shirts. I enjoy making different holiday t-shirts for my son as well as some matching things for my dogs. But I also do it for fun and will make things for other people just for a very small price to cover the cost of the material but it's yeah just something that I enjoy doing and try to do it in my free time when I can and I enjoy looking at my creations when they're made.
Videos/82777/Visite_1/82777_Question_3_2024-12-07_19-06-54_Video.mp4,1,And an activity that I hate doing is tidying up. I don't mind the actual like cleaning, like vacuuming or wiping surfaces, but I have so much stuff that I just will put it in a room and try to forget about it. And then I'll get more things and put it in that room. And it's almost like a hoarding situation just in that room though. And I always tell myself, okay when I have more time I'm gonna go through it and clean it and that's been like three years that I've said that I was going to do it and I just never do or then I'll say I'm gonna do it for like 20 minutes but then it's just so overwhelming I don't know where to start or it's like 20 minutes is not gonna make a difference or then I find a place for it somewhere else but it's just moving it from that space into a different space which also there isn't room for so something that I need to do I just I don't and I hate it I hate tidying up. Just putting more stuff and forgetting about it.
Videos/82777/Visite_1/82777_Question_4_2024-12-07_19-05-16_Video.mp4,1,An activity that I like to do is eating junk food, specifically cookies. I'm definitely an emotional eater. If I'm feeling stressed, I will absolutely need to have like a sugar fix. I wish this was something I didn't need to do. I have gained about 60 pounds in the past year when my life has been extra stressful. I really wish I could stop it, but if I don't, I will just go absolutely crazy. And if there's no junk food in the house, I will usually just make cookies or make something so I have something to eat and just stuff into my mouth and make me feel better.

And then I would let my dog out. Sometimes I would go out with him and stand on the deck just to watch him while he goes pee or something like that.

I really like the social aspect of it. I like, it is kind of my only social outlet. So it's where I spend a lot of time with friends and like get to talk to other people and engage with other people. So for me, the social component is big. I think I'm also a competitive person and I really enjoy the the pursuit of getting better like sometimes for me it's not even actually playing the game it's researching the game and like looking at other people employing different strategies and then practicing them and like training modes and practice modes so yeah I think I mean for me video games are kind of like a like a whole package I think it'd be like a bit negative too sometimes but because they just It can be all consuming, but yeah, I think for me, it's, it would be that.
Videos/82598/Visite_1/82598_Question_3_2024-11-01_17-43-37_Video.mp4,1,I really don't like doing the laundry. I find it very difficult to manage the time component of it because you put the laundry in and then there's a time where it's spinning, but then you have to take it out and put it on the line or the dryer. And then that's like another section of time. And then you have to take it and fold it. And that's like another section of time. So it's just like this. It's kind of like three chores combined into one. and you can kind of like walk away from it so I guess it's not technically boring but I do find it annoying because I tend to forget and especially when it comes to like the folding portion I just find it so unengaging almost pointless I mean a lot of times I just like don't end up folding and then I don't know it kind of just spirals into the situation but I really do not like doing the laundry i think just yeah from the just the time component of it it feels really hard to fit into the day ever and also the folding of the clothes is really unenjoyable
Videos/82598/Visite_1/82598_Question_4_2024-11-01_17-41-59_Video-DESKTOP-NQ55E0P.mp4,1,I think an activity I would like to do but I don't do would be having more like social engagements in real life. So maybe going to like a local board game store and engaging with people and like going to that regularly, like a D&D, like a Dungeons and Dragons group or something like that. I think that would be really fun. But it's something that I've never done, like been confident enough to really go and do. but that would be an activity that I would really like to do I think
Videos/82598/Visite_1/82598_Question_5_2024-11-01_17-38-50_Video-DESKTOP-NQ55E0P.mp4,0,I think I am always willing to play video games. I think that's my primary hobby.

We play different. I play some games solo too, but primarily with the team because I prefer the competitive nature but yeah I'm almost always willing to do that if someone was to ask me I would be I would be down

Although it's something that I don't really do with my friends, but it's something that whenever anyone is ready that he wants to go to the gym with me, it's something that I can never say no to. It's something that I'm always willing to go. So even if it's not about me working out, but seeing the other person work out or tell the person one or two things that I know about working out. Because I'm really down for any of my friends to come up with me that he wants to go to the gym with me today. Something that I really want to see happening. So it's something I'm always willing to do.

As a graphic designer, I really need to start posting or being seen on social media, but I'm very anti-social. I don't post much or advertise what I do.

I am currently here in my painting studio, my drawing and painting studio, and it gives me joy because it is my first love. It's the thing I gain pleasure from. The thing I like to do most is to challenge myself through painting, through drawing, finding new things to do.

I've been playing guitar for a long time and I really like playing with my friends in a band that we formed. The reason why is it really lets me unwind and express myself, something that I can't really do at work, so I love doing that on the weekends.
Videos/82594/Visite_1/82594_Question_3_2024-10-02 16-35-15_Video.mp4,0,One activity that I really hate doing is cooking. I don't know if it's really a chore, it sort of is, because I have to cook for my family. One of the reasons I hate doing it is because I'm terrible at it. And no matter how many YouTube videos that I watch and try to get better and try to do new recipes, they always fail. So I usually try to avoid it as much as I can.
Videos/82594/Visite_1/82594_Question_4_2024-10-02 16-33-16_Video.mp4,1,A guilty pleasure that I like to do is go out to bars with my friends after work and drink wine, usually expensive wine, and go into expensive restaurants. I know it's probably not best for my health, but I still really love to do it.
Videos/82594/Visite_1/82594_Question_5_2024-10-02 16-30-31_Video.mp4,0,I'm almost always willing to go out after work with my friends. We usually like to go to a restaurant or a bar and have a few drinks to unwind. Sometimes we have dinner and sometimes we go to a movie afterwards as well.
Videos/82594/Visite_1/82594_Question_6_2024-10-02 16-31-17_Video.mp4,1,Something that some of my friends do at work and even after work is smoke or smoke marijuana. It's something that I don't do and I don't want to do, but I'm not adverse to it. If they want to do it, that's fine, but I don't do it.
Videos/82594/Visite_1/82594_Question_7_2024-10-02 16-32-18_Video.mp4,1,I put off finishing my schooling. I wanted to finish my Bachelor in Psychology, but I haven't finished it because of work. I still want to do it, but work has kind of overtaken that right now at this point, but I still want to do it.
Videos/82632/Visite_1/82632_Question_1_2024-11-06_14-25-48_Video-DESKTOP-NQ55E0P.mp4,0,Uh, I brush my teeth. It's an easy morning thing to do. Brush my teeth, brush my hair, go to the bathroom. That's about it.
Videos/82632/Visite_1/82632_Question_2_2024-11-06_14-32-20_Video.mp4,1,Well, um, okay, so for now, I guess, um, bike riding, even though it's the one that caused my injury, I can't wait to get back out there again. Uh, just the air and the leaves, and I can ride all year long now. So global warming has one good side effect. That's the only thing, I'm sorry. But yeah, I just love getting out there on my bike and into nature. Not as good as horseback riding, but it's pretty good.
Videos/82632/Visite_1/82632_Question_3_2024-11-06_14-31-30_Video.mp4,0,I hate talking about something to death before we do it. If we've talked about it, we know it. I don't like repeating things. When I go shopping, I shop at one spot, and I go to the next, and the next, and the next. I don't go back around. That makes me angry. And I do that with my life, my conversations. There's got to be a point. And you can't just prevaricate around. them
Videos/82632/Visite_1/82632_Question_4_2024-11-06_14-30-42_Video-DESKTOP-NQ55E0P.mp4,1,Okay, well, I don't really want to stop my guilty pleasures. I don't have a lot of them left anymore. But I do want to cut down on the amount of chocolate I eat. Um, activity I don't do but would like to. I'd love to be more physically active. I'm trying and I'm getting there. Just every time I get an injury, boom, I'm back at square. Not square one. I'd say square five right now, because it's a pretty bad arm injury. So, I want to get... I'd love to go up in a hot air balloon, but my biggest goal is I want to go back horse riding again, and that will be hopefully within a year.
Videos/82632/Visite_1/82632_Question_5_2024-11-06_14-28-45_Video.mp4,0,Always willing to watch a short TV show or a video with them. Have a coffee. Stuff like that. Just have a chat. See how everyone's doing.
Videos/82632/Visite_1/82632_Question_6_2024-11-06_14-26-55_Video-DESKTOP-NQ55E0P.mp4,1,Well, I'm not one of those people who will go, you know, out shopping in like really grubby pajamas or like a bathrobe. When I'm feeling sick or something like that, yeah. But part of getting myself to go out in public, it means I have to kind of get myself ready. So yeah, I am just not ever have been the type of person who will wear my pajamas at the mall.
Videos/82632/Visite_1/82632_Question_7_2024-11-06_14-28-05_Video.mp4,1,Something I could have done by now. Well, let's see. I could have been remarried again by now probably many times. Just avoiding relationships. Well, I did it for the last 20 years. Trying not to avoid them now. So, yeah, I avoided that for 20 years. But something I'm putting off or haven't decided on. I decided I'm not putting up anything anymore. I'm trying to make inroads at stuff that I want to get done. I like to do one little thing every day just to make myself feel good. Man, my lips look weird in here.
Videos/82753/Visite_1/82753_Question_1_2024-11-28_10-01-43_Video.mp4,0,So after waking up, I usually brush my teeth and then make breakfast. That's all.
Videos/82753/Visite_1/82753_Question_2_2024-11-28_10-16-09_Video.mp4,1,So an activity that brings me joy, I love reading. As I said earlier on in my previous videos, I love reading a lot. And when I read, I find the solace, I find the solitude, I find this peace within me. So reading brings me a lot of joy. It's a way for me to escape from reality a bit and, you know, just have like a me time. In the meantime, I just feel like I'm the only person in the world at that particular moment. So reading helps me a lot.
Videos/82753/Visite_1/82753_Question_3_2024-11-28_10-09-06_Video.mp4,0,For something I find very boring and annoying, it's like being in public places. There are lots of different personalities, different people. So it irritates me because not everybody is like me. So I have to adjust to them and that's something I find very, very annoying. I don't like it at all being in public spaces, seeing different personalities and seeing different personality traits of people.
Videos/82753/Visite_1/82753_Question_4_2024-11-28_10-13-21_Video.mp4,1,So a guilty pleasure I have is that I like watching cartoons. Yes, I love watching cartoons even at my age. So I feel like it's an activity that when friends find out or people find out, it'd be kind of like an embarrassment to me. Yes. So watching cartoons. I would like to stop, but it just has a way that it gives to me and makes me happy. So that's what I would want to do. I want to stop, but it's been a bit difficult for me.
Videos/82753/Visite_1/82753_Question_5_2024-11-28_10-06-58_Video.mp4,1,So with an activity that I would always and I'm willing to do is I love books. So I would want to have a book club, you know, when my friends call me around for book club meetings, I'm really like very quick to do so. That's something that I'll always or I'm always willing to do.
Videos/82753/Visite_1/82753_Question_6_2024-11-28_10-03-39_Video.mp4,1,So I don't like gossip, so I wouldn't... My friends gossip, I would like my friends gossip at home, but I prefer not to do that because it contradicts my personal beliefs.
Videos/82753/Visite_1/82753_Question_7_2024-11-28_10-05-25_Video.mp4,1,So I've been wanting to have a lip gloss brand for some time now but I've been skipping it. I haven't found the right time or the right moment to do it so that's something that I could have done by now but I haven't done yet.
Videos/82569/Visite_1/82569_Question_1_2024-10-02 15-57-13_Video.mp4,0,After waking up, I usually go to the washroom, do what I got to do, wash my face, and then go have breakfast, bring my cell phone along, my smartphone, look at emails or any messages from work that may have come in overnight, or from different time zones specifically, so overnight for me. and make breakfast. And why I'm thinking about the activity in making breakfast is simply because that's my routine. I make coffee, number one, to get energized in the morning. I work from home, so it's very important to get my caffeine going and get my hunger satiated in the morning. So it could be usually something quick and healthy, like a bowl of cereal or oatmeal with like protein powder and milk something quick simple yet nutritious and that's my morning routine then going to turn on my computer and getting started for the day
Videos/82569/Visite_1/82569_Question_2_2024-10-02 16-02-30_Video.mp4,1,The activity that brings me joy, like a hobby, I guess it's cycling. I do like to go, especially in the summertime, take a long bicycle ride. I have an e-bike, so it's not super strenuous, but it's more of an enjoyable activity where I could relax and just take in the scenery. And it's de-stressing going out in nature, and again, for not really doing something super strenuous, but for example, having the wind to your face and the sunshine coming down on a nice beautiful day and going on a nice route. It is enjoyable and relaxing for me.
Videos/82569/Visite_1/82569_Question_3_2024-10-02 16-03-24_Video.mp4,0,Well, something that came up today, actually, a chore that I find boring or annoying is getting up early or getting out of my routine and doing recycling and taking out the trash. Something that is weekly, yet still a chore and something of a task that needs to be done. but I find boring or annoying, especially since they pass by sorely to pick it up, and I have to have it ready and get it out on the curb, which gets me out of my regular morning routine once in a week, once a week. Thank you.
Videos/82569/Visite_1/82569_Question_4_2024-10-02 16-01-31_Video.mp4,1,Well, I guess a continuation of my previous responses in terms of eating healthy. I do have a guilty pleasure of eating pizza. That is my favorite food and has been so it's not exactly the most healthy but and that trust me I've cut back. So that is something of a guilty pleasure that I'd like to stop doing so much. And an activity that I'd like to continue doing or doing more often would be going to the gym working out just getting healthier in general so kind of go hand in hand together eating less pizza and working out more
Videos/82569/Visite_1/82569_Question_5_2024-10-02 16-00-27_Video.mp4,1,Well, an activity that I'm always willing to do, I do enjoy going to the lounge for a drink or sometimes to the cigar lounge as well. That is a common activity with work, either going out for drinks once in a while. Again, I work from home, so when colleagues either come into town or we want to get together, it's been a while, that's what happens. and when family for example my brother comes to town I do enjoy going to the cigar lounge it's something that's been a tradition for a few years not something that I do often but it is enjoyable so these are the activities that I'm almost willing to do
Videos/82569/Visite_1/82569_Question_6_2024-10-02 15-59-23_Video.mp4,0,Well, thinking about something, I guess, recent activities with people from work or friends, I guess it would be smoking weed. I don't really enjoy that or partake in it specifically, but it's a big, it's a common thing and it's accepted, but I just don't like it. It doesn't give me any pleasure or any satisfaction. so that's what I'm thinking of right now
Videos/82569/Visite_1/82569_Question_7_2024-10-02 15-58-21_Video.mp4,1,Well, today, I won't get into any existential crises or thoughts, but today, specifically, I did want to go to the gym, but was caught up in some work, so I wanted to go and come back and continue my work. So having done that, I was a little tired and sluggish, slept late last night, so I am putting it off and was putting it off until I felt a little bit better, perhaps taking you know quick power nap and getting some more coffee for example so um that's um currently something that i've been putting off in the immediate moment and haven't decided on quick yet
Videos/82694/Visite_1/82694_Question_1_2024-11-15_21-05-54_Video.mp4,0,so what I usually do after a week up is I try to check my email first I check my phone do like five minutes in social media and after that go to the washroom brush my teeth and then drink some water and after that I try to do some entertaining like watching TVs before before before I needed to go and take a shower for my work and all that.
Videos/82694/Visite_1/82694_Question_2_2024-11-15_21-09-21_Video.mp4,1,I'm happy was a drinks major I would say I'm collecting stuff like specially gameplay I tried to collect them and then sometimes I'm playing sports like basketball and some other sport as well I can play table tennis a little bit of tennis and then volleyball as well so yeah
Videos/82694/Visite_1/82694_Question_3_2024-11-15_21-11-03_Video.mp4,1,Now I would say for the chore, I have one chore that I would really hate is that is doing dishes because I feel like especially that in our apartment we don't have a dishwasher so I feel like it's kind of take a long time to do it and it's kind of dirty to do it as well so that's the most activity that I don't like to do.
Videos/82694/Visite_1/82694_Question_4_2024-11-15_21-10-12_Video.mp4,1,I would say shopping because I'm I kinda I kind of for me I kind of wanted to be like the first one to do new technology stuff like new cell phones laptops even like a keyboard on my computer new keyboard new headset and all that because most of the most of those stuff are expensive so maybe this is one of the shopping is shopping on a technology on technologies what I'm trying would like to stop it
Videos/82694/Visite_1/82694_Question_5_2024-11-15_21-07-41_Video.mp4,1,So first with friends I would say just going around out of town, driving around like we usually do and then for work, I don't really have any activities rather than just working, just doing my work and go home.
Videos/82694/Visite_1/82694_Question_6_2024-11-15_21-06-57_Video.mp4,1,I would say, when people at work, since a lot of people at work try to tease each and every one of my colleagues, try to tease each and every one of us and Chris and all that, I will not try that at home as I have two children under the age of five or living here, I don't want them to be exposed on that kind of behavior
Videos/82694/Visite_1/82694_Question_7_2024-11-15_21-08-37_Video.mp4,1,I would say studying again because currently I'm a blue technician in an old changed place and I've been wanting to study in a much higher position or like higher studies. I have a certificate for software and web developer and I also have experience in data analyst but I'm thinking about doing something higher like engineering and all that stuff
Videos/82578/Visite_1/82578_Question_1_2024-10-02 16-03-17_Video.mp4,0,when I wake up usually I check my mobile phone and I just see if there is anything left after that I just go to washroom brush my teeth and just get ready for my day for the day
Videos/82578/Visite_1/82578_Question_2_2024-10-02 16-04-10_Video.mp4,1,when I make a lot of money I feel joy that's the straight answer
Videos/82578/Visite_1/82578_Question_3_2024-10-02 16-04-27_Video.mp4,0,I really don't like to waste my time browsing like social medias they're just horrible
Videos/82578/Visite_1/82578_Question_4_2024-10-02 16-03-52_Video.mp4,1,I like to play football in my free time but right now I think it's not good because that time is not good enough for me so it would be much better if I don't play football
Videos/82578/Visite_1/82578_Question_5_2024-10-02 16-05-28_Video.mp4,1,I want to lead a disciplined life but I'm just unable to follow discipline rules.
Videos/82578/Visite_1/82578_Question_6_2024-10-02 16-04-46_Video.mp4,0,Black people and my friends do gossiping about different things unnecessarily. That's what I really don't want to do.
Videos/82578/Visite_1/82578_Question_7_2024-10-02 16-05-06_Video.mp4,0,I didn't make enough money to survive. I wish if I could do that I'd have a better life.
Videos/82609/Visite_1/82609_Question_1_2024-11-02_17-54-25_Video.mp4,0,I don't do anything activity after a week's class.
Videos/82609/Visite_1/82609_Question_2_2024-11-02_17-56-32_Video.mp4,0,I prefer drinking coffee in the morning and then watch some video or listening some music.
Videos/82609/Visite_1/82609_Question_3_2024-11-02_17-56-15_Video.mp4,0,I do not. Any activity don't like to do or something find boring or annoying.
Videos/82609/Visite_1/82609_Question_4_2024-11-02_17-55-52_Video-DESKTOP-NQ55E0P.mp4,0,I do not have any activities to enjoy at the moment.
Videos/82609/Visite_1/82609_Question_5_2024-11-02_17-55-09_Video-DESKTOP-NQ55E0P.mp4,0,I usually go to work in the morning and then going back to home at evening.
Videos/82609/Visite_1/82609_Question_6_2024-11-02_17-54-52_Video-DESKTOP-NQ55E0P.mp4,0,I'm sure I do not have any time at the moment.
Videos/82609/Visite_1/82609_Question_7_2024-11-02_17-55-31_Video-DESKTOP-NQ55E0P.mp4,0,I am doing my job in a computer at a technical and I have not doing in the past
Videos/82738/Visite_1/82738_Question_1_2024-11-27_15-33-35_Video.mp4,0,Well after waking up I usually try to get ready for the day right away. So do my hair, brush my teeth, wash my face, put a little bit of makeup on depending on where I'm going. And then usually by that time the kid is awake and I go to check on her and make sure that she gets fed, has a diaper change, and then continue on with my day.
Videos/82738/Visite_1/82738_Question_2_2024-11-27_15-39-32_Video.mp4,0,An activity that brings me joy is definitely walking, whether that's just in the neighbourhood, short distances or in a trail or along the beach. just walking is very therapeutic for me also of course good for physical health but I find that it also is great for emotional mental health and even well for me anyways spiritual health I guess you would say I find it's a time for me to just kind of connect with my religion and different aspects of that. I think it's a good time to pray and to dedicate myself to that just because it's usually very peaceful walking and you're not constantly being interrupted. You really have the time to just think and to take care of your health in so many different ways in such a such a short amount of time even.
Videos/82738/Visite_1/82738_Question_3_2024-11-27_15-40-42_Video.mp4,0,Something I don't like to do is going to the dentist. Of course I'm very grateful to have medical care and dental care and for the opportunity to go. but I just find that going, it usually causes a little bit of aches and pains in my mouth and it can last for a little while. Even if it's just a cleaning, it's usually not the most comfortable experience. And it's something that you of course have to take time out of your day to do and book an appointment. And sometimes it's not at the most convenient time. So I just, I don't like um, going at all, but definitely not more than, um, I have to. So, yeah.
Videos/82738/Visite_1/82738_Question_4_2024-11-27_15-37-59_Video.mp4,0,I will answer about the activity that I don't do but would like to do and that would be taking a painting class. I took one a couple years ago and I really enjoyed it and I found it very fun, very soothing, so that's definitely something that I would like to try again and have another kind of crack at.
Videos/82738/Visite_1/82738_Question_5_2024-11-27_15-34-34_Video.mp4,1,So that activity would be, I would say, grabbing coffee. I like to meet with friends to grab coffee. That's kind of like a default activity. If we don't, we can't really think of anything else to do at work. I like to take breaks during the day to grab a cup of coffee and at home as well. I always have one in the morning and sometimes if out and about I will grab a second cup but I'm always willing to enjoy a cup of coffee.
Videos/82738/Visite_1/82738_Question_6_2024-11-27_15-35-50_Video.mp4,0,Well, oftentimes people around me, family members and friends, not too sure about work, but I'm sure colleagues, they enjoy watching very gory, bloody movies. And that's something I am not wanting to do just because it scares me too much, grosses me out. So I try to avoid those kind of movies that are very gory as much as possible.
Videos/82738/Visite_1/82738_Question_7_2024-11-27_15-37-07_Video.mp4,1,um so that's something that I could have done by now but haven't done yet is planning um or I should say planning slash booking finalizing a venue for my wedding reception um uh we're just putting it off um because it always seems like something comes up and we're not able to dedicate the time to it right away because life just gets so busy and we haven't decided on anything yet anyway. So there is not much to do in that case if we don't have time to kind of explore the options.
Videos/82637/Visite_1/82637_Question_1_2024-11-07_17-57-08_Video.mp4,0,Every day after waking up, my first activity is usually checking my phone, turn off the alarm clock and check the calendar and the schedule of the day and also check some news of the day and that will be it.
Videos/82637/Visite_1/82637_Question_2_2024-11-07_18-08-09_Video.mp4,0,Well, again, the biggest hobby of mine would be fishing, to be specific, kayak fishing. The reason behind it is it can take me out and connect with the nature. I can appreciate the view, either it's a lake or it's a river. It gives me a sense of relaxation and also when you get a fish on, it always triggers that excitement and releases tons of dopamine. And after, you know, catch a fish, that sense of achievement could last for, you know, a few days or even a month if it is a good catch. So, yeah, I'm kind of like addicted to that already.
Videos/82637/Visite_1/82637_Question_3_2024-11-07_18-03-50_Video.mp4,0,Well, to be honest, I hate doing clean the dishes and clean the kitchen because it's repetitive and it's boring and it annoys me because, you know, you have to eat like, you know, three times at least one or two times a day. And yeah, it's kind of like repeating the same thing, get it dirty and wash it and store, sort it out in the store, the dishes, and then take them out and do that again. It's on and on. It seems it's never, there's never an end, of course. Yeah, so that kind of annoys me, but you have to do it.
Videos/82637/Visite_1/82637_Question_4_2024-11-07_18-05-35_Video.mp4,1,Well, one thing that I do but I really want to stop doing would be spending too much time on my phone just browsing and scanning those short videos. and some posts, just chips of information. Yeah, I really want to stop doing that. But apparently, I still have that habit. And whenever I have like three minutes or five minutes, I will just pick up the phone and do it. I'm coming.
Videos/82637/Visite_1/82637_Question_5_2024-11-07_18-02-16_Video.mp4,0,Well, the activity that I will always be down for it would be fishing. So I like to do it with my friends, with my co-worker, with my family member, take my kids out there and fishing. Yeah, it's always my number one activity that I would do when I have a day off or when the weather is good out there.
Videos/82637/Visite_1/82637_Question_6_2024-11-07_17-59-01_Video.mp4,0,If I really have to pick something, I guess it probably would be anything that involves physical activities like, well, dangerous physical activities like skydiving or rock climbing or some extreme sports. um well i i do understand that the thrill and the excitement people people can get from them but personally i i'd be sticking uh to supporting uh well i would be sticking to the sports that are more safe and relaxed to do
Videos/82637/Visite_1/82637_Question_7_2024-11-07_18-01-07_Video.mp4,1,Yeah, there's one online course about data science that I started off with like a year ago. I really wish I could have done it by, you know, before the end of this year, but it seems, Sometimes I haven't gone too far on that yet because things come up regularly and I just don't have enough time. Well that's an excuse but I guess I should have made more time for it to get it done. I really need to get it finished.

Yeah. Yeah.
Videos/82861/Visite_1/82861_Question_2_2025-02-19_11-35-31_Video.mp4,1,I love to be in the kitchen baking and cooking. I love to try new recipes, to mix ingredients together and spices. I love to be able to see something and recreate it however I see fit. And it's something that does take practice because you need to get used to the measurements, you need to have an idea, you know, of how much liquid can go into a cake, how much like liquid and spices you should put with meat, chicken, things like that. And so as I continue to cook and bake, I really learn different types of cuisines, tastes. And so it is something I enjoy. It does take time and I try to make time for it a few times a week at least. And it's just therapeutic and relaxing, you know, and I can focus on the kitchen right now.
Videos/82861/Visite_1/82861_Question_3_2025-02-19_11-34-10_Video.mp4,0,I don't like to dust. I'm okay with cleaning and grooming and vacuuming but I find dusting is just impossible to get rid of all the dust no matter how many wipes you use whatever you use there will always be dust and I just find that so annoying because I'm working hard to clean but just dust is there all the time.
Videos/82861/Visite_1/82861_Question_4_2025-02-19_11-36-31_Video.mp4,1,An activity I don't do, but I would like to, is to swim. When I was younger, I always loved swimming. It's such a good exercise as well. It's a full body workout. As well, like I said, you don't sweat, technically, when you swim. So it's something I really love to do. I just find that it's so hard, so much harder to go somewhere, get changed, you know, swim, and then you have to take a shower, you have to wash your hair all the time. and so it just takes a lot more time and effort than for example going for a walk so I don't do it and I would like to get back into it I just think I need to dedicate more time for it
Videos/82861/Visite_1/82861_Question_5_2025-02-19_11-32-34_Video.mp4,1,I try to always walk and I'm more than happy to welcome whoever wants to walk with me on a walk. I find it's good exercise and because I don't like to sweat really so walking you don't really sweat that much but you still get some good exercise and so I'm more than happy to do it with whoever wants to join me that could be my friends, my family, the dog, things like that.
Videos/82861/Visite_1/82861_Question_6_2025-02-19_11-31-50_Video.mp4,0,Well, some people around me smoke and that is something I choose not to do and I will never do because I'm aware of the negative consequences on the body and it's just something that I'm not interested in doing. So yeah.

Videos/82714/Visite_1/82714_Question_2_2024-11-18_18-29-04_Video.mp4,1,I like to walk in the park and just look at the trees. The park that I have here has got big, large trees, and I enjoy them because they're older, and they have been there for long before I was ever born, or even my grandparents. So I like walking through there. It's fresh air, too.
Videos/82714/Visite_1/82714_Question_3_2024-11-18_18-29-48_Video.mp4,1,I don't like cleaning my carpet. Every time around this year I need to clean my carpet and I don't like it because I have to get on my hands and knees and scrub. And it's hard work and it hurts my back.

Videos/82883/Visite_1/82883_Question_1_2025-02-22_21-48-07_Video.mp4,0,When I wake up, I usually go downstairs to turn on the kettle and get some hot water and I'll prepare some green tea. After that, I'll cook breakfast. So I have three eggs and then I will toast some whole grain toast and eat for about maybe 30 minutes. And after that, I'll wash my dishes and continue on with my day.
Videos/82883/Visite_1/82883_Question_2_2025-02-22_21-50-26_Video.mp4,0,An activity that brings me joy is playing on a curling league team. So I live here in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and I love the sport of curling. It gives me a time just to socialize with different other people while also having the aspects of physical activity. I love playing the game because there's strategy involved and I also get to make new friends on the ice.
Videos/82883/Visite_1/82883_Question_3_2025-02-22_21-49-34_Video.mp4,0,An activity that I don't particularly like to do is act as a chauffeur for my mom. So she is a home support worker, so she goes to different elderly people's places to give care such as personal hygiene care or cook for them. My mom doesn't drive and she is in her 60s now so it's difficult for her to travel around given the nature of her work, so I do have to drive her to different places. What I don't particularly like about this chore is that it does take a lot of my time out of my day, so I don't really have any free time to do what I wish. But she is close to retiring, so I am willing to sacrifice the time to drop her, and hopefully she has more comfort in doing her job when I do so. Thank you.
Videos/82883/Visite_1/82883_Question_4_2025-02-22_21-52-21_Video.mp4,1,An activity that I don't do but would like to do is try out Jiu Jitsu. I believe that every person should know the basics of self-defense. However, I think what's stopping me is a few reasons. Number one is the financial commitment. I know that it is a little bit expensive to partake in these extracurricular activities. Second one is I would be completely new. I know that there are adult classes, but I think there's still this, I suppose, how would I say this, self-consciousness that I am a little bit older, I'm approaching 30. And then when I think of doing these extracurricular activities, I see that there are much more younger people, or I think there's much more younger people. So I guess there is a little bit of hesitancy that I don't want to embarrass myself, or, you know, I may not be seen as strong when I partake in these extracurricular activities. So that, those are the few reasons that are making me stop or try out these new things. But I do intend to try out jujitsu in March.
Videos/82883/Visite_1/82883_Question_5_2025-02-22_21-56-19_Video.mp4,1,An activity that I'm almost always willing to do is go on a date with my partner. I don't usually get to spend a lot of time with him, so if I can just go to a small cafe or go for a walk around the park and just spend time with him, that would really make my day. So I will most always say yes to that.
Videos/82883/Visite_1/82883_Question_6_2025-02-22_21-53-54_Video.mp4,1,Common thing that people around me do that I would like to do but cannot do is living in with a partner. In my culture, it is not acceptable to be living in with a boyfriend or girlfriend unless you are married. And for me, I'm not really interested in doing that. so I would like to live with my partner. But it would bring some negative emotions on both my parents as well as extended family members. And while I am an adult now and I get to choose how to live my life, there is that balance of trying to appease them, but also living my own life to the fullest.
Videos/82883/Visite_1/82883_Question_7_2025-02-22_21-55-21_Video.mp4,1,Something that I could have done by now is live abroad and have or start a career in a different country. I've been living in Vancouver, Canada all my life and honestly I'm getting a little bit bored now. My plan was to move or at least try to move by age 26. so it's been a few years after that and I'm still here I'm still living with my parents so that is something that I've been putting off not necessarily because of my own choices but there were external factors that required me to stay home those factors have now slowly resolve themselves. So now I am, I guess, in the hunt of continuing this pursuit of living abroad and starting my career in a different country.

Videos/82564/Visite_1/82564_Question_2_2024-10-02 15-42-17_Video.mp4,0,So scuba diving would be my number one thing. I've always loved the ocean since I was little, but since I got certified as a scuba diver in almost 15 years ago, it just brought so much joy to me. Just you see a completely different world under there. Like looking at the ocean from above is nothing. Like you can't really grasp what's happening underneath the surface. So it brings me so much joy and a lot of my travel is around diving i'll always make sure if there's an ocean of course or a lake or a body of water i always make sure that i can dive
Videos/82564/Visite_1/82564_Question_3_2024-10-02 15-44-53_Video.mp4,1,Making the bed. I hate making the bed. I've never understood why people make their bed. I do realize that sometimes it just looks nicer, but I'm a person that once I leave the bedroom in the morning, I'm basically never in there again. So I never see the bed. So to spend time making the bed and putting the pillows on and all that stuff to me for something that I'm not going to use at night and at night, I'm going to literally undo what I just did. It just makes no sense. I'm completely fine with not making the bed.

I I do a gym session normally for an hour, an hour and a half. Depends on what time I have classes. Sometimes I have classes in the morning. Therefore, I have to cut it short.

And they have a laundry card. And if I have to fill it, then the card, top or upper, machine is up on the second floor so then I have to hike up to there and and there's always of course the fear that someone will steal your clothes because they're unmanned and are they going to come out clean because so many people are using the same machines and there's only one washer and one dryer for the whole floor so it is a awful chore I suppose it would be a lot better if I had a washer and dryer inside my apartment or a home if I were a homeowner but yeah it's it's it's a chore all right

You know, all these little tiny dots, basically, that form together to form a wonderful picture. It's also a little bit complex. There's a quite what I was expecting when I was getting into needlecraft. You have to count the spaces both that you need to stitch and that you need to skip.

I mean we clean it once a week so it's not that bad but still you are handling you know feces and the litter always gets everywhere and it sticks in the corners so you have to get in there with like a scrub brush and a cloth and get the corners clean before you put all the fresh litter in otherwise it's just completely pointless to have cleaned it if you're leaving stuff in in the box that's probably my least favorite chore

If there's people around, you can get together, You can talk about the smells and the tastes and, you know, what do you like versus I like, et cetera. And if you're alone, it's just a great time to really just focus on what you're doing and enjoy it.

Videos/82585/Visite_1/82585_Question_1_2024-10-02 16-08-41_Video.mp4,0,When I wake up the first thing I do is I grab my phone, I go to my Bible app, I do my daily devotions, I pray and after praying I go to my social medias, I go to check updates, I check the news, I go to my Soccer Front page, I read football news, then I reply my messages.
Videos/82585/Visite_1/82585_Question_2_2024-10-02 16-10-58_Video.mp4,1,An activity that gives me joy is time spent with my family and personal spends to myself. I like peace. I like being alone. I don't like being with too many new people.
Videos/82585/Visite_1/82585_Question_3_2024-10-02 16-09-36_Video-DESKTOP-NQ55E0P.mp4,1,Well, something I don't like to do is I don't like to go to the clubs because I feel like there's too many crowds, too many people in the club. You don't have written space, you don't have a space of your own, you don't have your privacy. So so many people enjoy it in the club. Why I just find the club a noisy, busy and insecure place because most clubs, they have only one entrance, you know.
Videos/82585/Visite_1/82585_Question_4_2024-10-02 16-10-17_Video-DESKTOP-NQ55E0P.mp4,1,Well, an activity I do and I'd like to stop is smoking weed. I smoke a lot of marijuana and it derives so much potasio from it. But to be very honest, I'm working towards stopping. Though it's been hard, but yeah, I'm getting there.
Videos/82585/Visite_1/82585_Question_5_2024-10-02 16-12-53_Video.mp4,0,An activity I love to do is I love to play FIFA with my friends at home and maybe when I'm on break at work I love to play FIFA.
Videos/82585/Visite_1/82585_Question_6_2024-10-02 16-11-40_Video.mp4,0,Well, at work, something people do and I don't like to do is buzzing other people around. Maybe like a new staff buzzing a new staff around, pushing people around. I don't like to do that.
Videos/82585/Visite_1/82585_Question_7_2024-10-02 16-13-56_Video.mp4,1,Well, something I could have done by now and which I've not done is getting married. Not like I'm putting it off, but I'm just undecided on how to, or if to, or when to.
Videos/82557/Visite_1/82557_Question_1_2024-08-22 14-46-11_Video.mp4,1,After waking up, I usually check my phone, make sure all my alarms are off, and then I will get out of bed, sometimes make my bed, sometimes not, go brush my teeth, use the washroom and take a shower before I go to work as I work from home.
Videos/82557/Visite_1/82557_Question_2_2024-08-22 14-49-16_Video.mp4,1,A hobby I've really gotten into recently is solo board games. So it's just like board games and physical games that you can play by yourself. It's just a lot easier as I used to play a lot with my friends. But as summer's ending, we're going back to our separate universities. I don't really have the same people I could play with as often. So being able to play by myself and do those same things is something that is really good for me. Thank you.
Videos/82557/Visite_1/82557_Question_3_2024-08-22 14-48-26_Video.mp4,1,For a chore I don't like to do, I would say driving around my brother. Oftentimes, my parents ask me to take him where he needs to go, hang out with his friends, go to the gym, drop him off places generally. So it just gets a little bit annoying for me. For the why, I say I wouldn't mind it if I did that as a job. but sometimes when I'm comfortable at home, I don't really want to get up and drive him around where he needs to be. I feel like he could take the bus because that's what I did when I was his age.
Videos/82557/Visite_1/82557_Question_4_2024-08-22 14-47-13_Video.mp4,1,For an activity that I enjoy but would like to stop, I would say going to the casino. I've only been twice now, with my friends both times, but I can see why it's addicting and I can see how I would get myself into a hole with that activity, because it can get bad pretty fast.
Videos/82557/Visite_1/82557_Question_5_2024-08-22 14-50-19_Video.mp4,0,Same thing as the last question, I would say I'm always going to play a game of any sort. Not even a video game, just a physical game, whether it be a board game or a competitive game. Even at work, we have days where we'll go outside and play games in the parking lot, like just tossing the ball around. Sometimes I prefer competitive, but at any given time, I'll be fine playing any type of game with people.
Videos/82557/Visite_1/82557_Question_6_2024-08-22 14-52-25_Video.mp4,1,There are a lot of things I would prefer not to do, but as far as not willing to do, at any given time, I'd say I'm not willing to order food using like delivery apps. I find that super wasteful because of the fees and surcharges. I'd rather take the bus or I often have access to a car while I'm at home. So I'd rather drive the five minutes and pay the like dollar in gas and the gas I'd have to put in the car to go pick up my own food. because a lot of people at work like to order in food. That's down the street. A lot of my friends do it at university rather than just walk the 15 minutes. And at home, I know a lot of my family and friends do it as well, which is just not for me.
Videos/82557/Visite_1/82557_Question_7_2024-08-22 14-53-18_Video.mp4,1,something I've not done yet that I really was looking into doing was investing. I've put in money over the years here and there, a total of maybe $2,000 now. But because I've been working at an internship over the summer and I've been putting a lot of the money away in savings, my friends and I have been talking about investing in different things, which I think could be good. But sometimes it just feels a little bit risky. Thank you.
Videos/82708/Visite_1/82708_Question_1_2024-11-18_14-51-58_Video.mp4,0,After I wake up, I usually go to the washroom and then brush my teeth, wash my face, and change and get ready for work.

Videos/82781/Visite_1/82781_Question_7_2024-12-09_15-47-30_Video.mp4,1,cleaning my house and doing laundry.
Videos/82735/Visite_1/82735_Question_1_2024-11-23_15-05-10_Video.mp4,1,After getting up in the morning, I typically get dressed and pour myself breakfast immediately in order to prepare for the day. Simple to, as quickly as possible, move forward along my path of task completion. Brush my teeth, tie my hair, and leave the house.
Videos/82735/Visite_1/82735_Question_2_2024-11-23_15-08-13_Video.mp4,1,Exercise brings me joy. While it is something that simultaneously is challenging and creates physical pain, and often I find that I am challenging mental stresses against it, at the same time it is the rewarding aspect of it that brings me a deep, deep joy inside. And And often prior to exercise or at times during exercise, I will be facing a lot of pain, a desire to stop. But, you know, often when I have moments of refreshment or even when I have a second wind, I am met with great pulses of refreshment. And I find that all of the difficulty and restraint, resistance that I felt throughout that was sufficiently supported by the pleasure that I am faced with afterwards.
Videos/82735/Visite_1/82735_Question_3_2024-11-23_15-10-10_Video.mp4,1,Work. I don't particularly like my work. I do, but I don't. I enjoy aspects of it which are rewarding in the skill development and interaction with humans aspect, but altogether I do not find my work to be rewarding in a deeper space. I I don't find that it fulfills my personal interests or desire to solve problems because it is in a completely unrelated field of information. I make coffee, but I do not really want to make coffee for a living. I like to make coffee for myself. I like to drink coffee, but I would rather be working on other problems that have to do with developing systems that work with computers. So making coffee is not really a deep satisfaction for me. So that's why I don't like it. While I enjoy details of doing tasks, it is that it doesn't have a deep sense of reward. At the end of the day, it is more like I am killing time and making money out of necessity, rather than being able to profit off of something which is, you know, in a way, deeply refreshing.
Videos/82735/Visite_1/82735_Question_4_2024-11-23_15-06-18_Video.mp4,1,I would like to practice art more often, considering I have had a lot of interest in art throughout my whole life, but have not given, at least in the last few years, much attention into practicing that. It is something that I would like to do more often. Drawing, music, writing, all things that are very important to me and which I enjoy the creations of others constantly, but do not to the extent that I would like to delve into on my own time as a product of my own thoughts.
Videos/82735/Visite_1/82735_Question_5_2024-11-23_15-14-21_Video.mp4,1,I'm always willing to take a moment to relax. I find it very important nowadays to constantly push myself as much as I can. But at the same time, I've made it clear to myself that I need to accept that I have to breathe. I've found in work that the people that have stuck around the longest, they do not constantly burn out of all of the energy that they have. They take time to breathe, settle themselves, even if it's for just a minute or a moment. It is important to take moments to relax, to let go of the pressure of constantly striving for more and harder work and to just breathe, chill out and accept moments of passiveness.
Videos/82735/Visite_1/82735_Question_6_2024-11-23_15-11-44_Video.mp4,0,People that I know stand up for a lot of socially conservative ideologies, and generally those are just not things that I also stand up for. So, this is among many things I would not do personally.
Videos/82735/Visite_1/82735_Question_7_2024-11-23_15-12-51_Video.mp4,0,There are many things in life which we could have done. I could have studied harder in the past. I could have learned more things in the past. These are not things that I necessarily regret as they are core to the development of my personality as I am today. However, something that I could have done today and haven't is brush my teeth. It's starting to get about halfway through the day. I've had breakfast, I've had coffee, and still I have not brushed my teeth. I think that is quite a fundamental aspect of self-care, which I have not yet attended to and maybe I should.
Videos/82722/Visite_1/82722_Question_1_2024-11-19_13-43-57_Video.mp4,0,I usually go on a group Zoom meeting with probably 30 other participants while I'm having my coffee and then I spend some time with myself.
Videos/82722/Visite_1/82722_Question_2_2024-11-19_13-46-07_Video.mp4,1,Well, I like to go for walks basically in nature. I usually take my time and go for half an hour walk every couple of days. That gives me great joy, some peace, and I think it really helps my mental health.
Videos/82722/Visite_1/82722_Question_3_2024-11-19_13-45-27_Video.mp4,1,Well, I need to do some work at my house. Basically most work that I can do myself. But I continue to put it off.

And part of what I should do to maintain my sobriety is help others. And I know by helping others, it helps me probably just as much or more than it does the other person who I'm trying to help.
Videos/82722/Visite_1/82722_Question_6_2024-11-19_13-49-04_Video.mp4,1,I don't like socializing when there's alcohol involved especially when people who get under the influence it makes me feel really uncomfortable part of my disease of alcoholism why it was so attractive for me was that it helped me to socialize more and I'll find during social situations the urge to drink to fit in more services and I don't like I don't want to go back
Videos/82722/Visite_1/82722_Question_7_2024-11-19_13-47-57_Video.mp4,1,Well, I began dating a girl that I dated many, many years ago, and she lives around about 600 kilometers away. And our intention is to move in together. We've been doing it basically by commuting. And I said I was going to move in this past summer, but I'm finding it difficult to let go of living with myself. making the physical move in general.

Videos/82710/Visite_1/82710_Question_2_2024-11-18_15-54-23_Video.mp4,0,So a hobby that really brings me joy is trying out new cultures, cuisines, and dishes that I haven't tried before as I'm a big foodie.
Videos/82710/Visite_1/82710_Question_3_2024-11-18_15-54-52_Video.mp4,1,So one of the chores that I find boring or annoying is folding laundry. I find it so redundant and unnecessary since you're going to be using the clothes in any ways. So, yeah.
Videos/82710/Visite_1/82710_Question_4_2024-11-18_15-54-04_Video.mp4,1,So an activity that I would like to stop guilty pleasure is watching so much sports in the evening and more utilizing that time to be more productive and efficient in terms of getting my errands and such completed.
Videos/82710/Visite_1/82710_Question_5_2024-11-18_15-55-21_Video.mp4,1,So an activity that I'm always willing to do with friends, work or home is helping out, stepping up, lending a helping hand and being supportive.
Videos/82710/Visite_1/82710_Question_6_2024-11-18_15-56-23_Video.mp4,1,So something that people do around me that I wouldn't necessarily do is try not to be negative and condescending, trying to stay positive and keeping in mind everyone's best interests.
Videos/82710/Visite_1/82710_Question_7_2024-11-18_15-55-51_Video.mp4,1,So one of the things that I've been putting off or haven't done yet is getting my PMP certification as I've tried to study, do practice exams and such, and I just keep on being lazy and procrastinating.
Videos/82755/Visite_1/82755_Question_1_2024-11-28_10-55-32_Video.mp4,1,After waking up, I normally get out of bed. I check my phone, make my way downstairs to the bathroom. I'll wash my face and dump a bunch of water on my head to get rid of bed head. Then I'll chug a big glass of water so I don't feel dehydrated for the morning.
Videos/82755/Visite_1/82755_Question_2_2024-11-28_10-59-17_Video.mp4,1,So I'm a big rugby player. I really enjoy the sport and playing the game. I've gotten to the point where I'm pretty good at it, so I can win or succeed a lot, which always feels good. there's also a really really good community in my city for rugby so they're like i know a lot of people it's almost like an extended family at this point my club and i love hanging out with them
Videos/82755/Visite_1/82755_Question_3_2024-11-28_11-01-15_Video.mp4,1,Something I really don't like to do is clean up around the house. I know it's something I gotta do and it drives people I live with crazy if I don't, but I just really find it uninteresting and boring. I'd rather go do a million different things than clean the bathroom or mop the floors or whatever the chore may be, I've got ADHD. So then just sitting down and doing one task for a long time if it's not interesting is incredibly, incredibly difficult.
Videos/82755/Visite_1/82755_Question_4_2024-11-28_11-00-14_Video.mp4,1,So an activity that I don't do but would like to do is I want to start rock climbing. The university I'm at has a rock climbing club and I've always thought it was fun. My friend always thinks it looks fun.

So a lot of the times in the last few months, if one of us texts the other going, let's play ping pong right now, we'll just kind of drop whatever we do and go play ping pong. Normally we're at school, so it's not a hard sell to stop studying to go play.

Technically, I'm still working just on a med leave, but I still have people reaching out to me from time to time. This is something I really don't enjoy. I don't want to talk to people when they are not my own friends or family. But I try to do that if I have to. For example, if that brings us money, like if I can take home salary, but I'm not while I'm on mat leave.
Videos/82683/Visite_1/82683_Question_4_2024-11-14_09-23-27_Video.mp4,1,I would definitely say being unhealthy is something I would like to stop. For example, eating instant noodles. That's something I do feel pleasure, but something I think is not good for my own health.

But the main activity that I do is going and getting my cat her food. So I'll get out of bed. She usually is on the ground meowing at me, asking me to, you know, get her that food right away because, you know, she needs it. She's starving, of course. and so I'll get up head to the kitchen and then go to the cupboard grab her food out of there use the scoop put that in her bowl and then I'll check to see how the water is doing and then once I do that if it needs refilling I will fill a cup and put some more water into her bowl and that's one of the things that I do usually right away when I get up next thing I do after that is get my coffee ready
Videos/82688/Visite_1/82688_Question_2_2024-11-14_13-54-54_Video.mp4,1,So a hobby that really brings me joy is actually something I started recently, improv. So I've always loved being creative and dramatic and just having a really fun time and being silly. I've always been charismatic and kind of out there. I don't usually get embarrassed very easily. And so I decided that I wanted to find something that would kind of be like that, but as a hobby, because I didn't want it to be something that I was doing for work or anything like that. So after kind of doing some, you know, investigating online, I found this improv course. So I went to that this past Saturday and it was honestly the most fun. I feel like I got to meet some really great people while I was there and really push myself out of my own comfort zone, force myself to be a bit more spontaneous, to really pay attention to others, be in the moment and just have a good time. So it was really fun. And I think that's why I enjoyed it because it lets you be fun while also, you know, pushing you out of your comfort zone a little bit.
Videos/82688/Visite_1/82688_Question_3_2024-11-14_14-03-44_Video.mp4,1,One activity that I really dislike doing is putting my laundry away. And part of that is when I've washed my sheets and I have to make my bed. I find that when it comes to laundry, you do it and then you never have enough space to actually put all that clean laundry away because half the time your closet is filled with half of your clean stuff and then half the other stuff is in the laundry bin and then you don't have enough room to put it back. And it's also such a laborious process. I feel like it just ends up taking so long because you have to fold everything or hang them up on the hangers. Then you have to figure out where you want to put it. And then what if you don't have enough hangers or space to put things? And so it just ends up becoming this really laborious process. And when it comes to making the bed specifically and putting the sheets on, that is always a struggle to just make sure everything fits properly. And especially if you've washed your duvet cover and you need to put that onto your duvet, it's a lot of work, especially as a smaller person. So I would say that is probably the most annoying and boring one because it's just and it's so tedious and you consistently have to do it no matter what.

I find that it's in moderation, very fun and a good time, but I find that I tend to use it a little more often than I should. and I find that it becomes a guilty pleasure for me. And I want to force myself, well, not force myself, but I want to be able to, you know, hold myself back and be able to actually, you know, stop smoking it as much as I do. I think that again, like I said, in moderation, everything in moderation, but there is a sense to which I know that at certain moments, I don't need it and I'm smoking it anyways, just because I can. and I find that it's more so I want to have a bit of self-control and feel like, you know, I am in control of it. It's not in control of me.
Videos/82688/Visite_1/82688_Question_5_2024-11-14_14-07-28_Video.mp4,1,An activity that I'm almost always willing to do with my friends is go shopping. So specifically though, it's going to be thrift shopping or consignment shopping. It is arguably one of the most fun things to do. I like just being able to spend time with my friends, A, but B, it's more fun than just like regular shopping because typically things are priced at a lower cost so you can maybe get more bang for your buck. But at the same time, you have to kind of dig a little bit more. So it's more fun to go through the pieces and kind of show your friends like, Ooh, you know, I got this, or what do you think of that? Um, and kind of get those opinions. So it makes it like a more interactive and fun experience. And I love shopping and spending time with my friends. And the combination of both is something that I'm literally always pretty much down for because it's one of the most fun things to me.
Videos/82688/Visite_1/82688_Question_6_2024-11-14_14-20-51_Video.mp4,1,So this is actually a difficult question because I feel like there's not much that I wouldn't really do, especially with the people that I'm surrounded by. There are lots of good people and I feel like most of the things they would do, I would have no issue at least doing once. You know, and it might not be my thing fully, but I would probably, you know, at least do that with them. The one thing that I can think of that I would definitely not be willing to do, though, is engaging in a religious ceremony with friends or family only because I'm not religious myself. And I feel like that would be just wrong of me to attend something like that or be willing to engage in something like that if I'm not actually someone who is of that faith or belief in that. I want to respect them as much as I can. I would happily meet them at their religious place after and hang out with them in a non-religious way. But I would not be willing to attend that ceremony or the event or whatever was going on simply because I wouldn't want to impose. And given my own beliefs, I just don't think that would be right. But I'm happy to still engage with them in that setting. But I wouldn't be willing to necessarily do those other pieces of it, like engaging in the worship or the faith-based activities. Thank you.

So my birthday is in December and I'm just going to do something low key with three of my friends. But I chose the date, I saved the date a while back, but I haven't figured out what I'm going to be doing yet. I've been brainstorming, deciding whether or not I want to go out to maybe a restaurant or a wine bar or something like that. Or if I want to do something more low key at my place and just maybe, you know, get matching PJs and watch a cute movie and hang out. So it's something that I need to do because December is quickly approaching. But I've definitely been putting it off because I haven't figured out exactly what it is that I want to do yet because I feel like I want a combination of both. But I also know myself enough to know that I'm probably not going to actually want to do both on the day of because it's going to be a lot and I'm going to end up wanting to spend some time by myself at the end of the night sleeping. Because especially if I'm drinking, I'm going to want to sleep probably early because I get tired really fast. So I also need to give my friends more time so that they can figure out what they're going to be wearing or save money if it's going to cost something and also reservations or booking something, right? And making sure that you can do that.
